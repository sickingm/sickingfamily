					<div class="poem">
						The once was a snail who, when put on a scale,<br>
						Weighed three thousand pounds and a quarter.<br>
						&quot;Dear me!&quot; said she, &quot;I'll lose weight in the sea.<br>
						&quot;I simply must stay in the water.&quot;<p>So with this silly 
						notion she jumped in the ocean<br>
						With the thought of turning out trim.<br>
						But she found out too late as she dived to her fate<br>
						That she was unable to swim.</div>
