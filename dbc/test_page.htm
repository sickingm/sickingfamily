    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">The meeting got off to a 
    	trepidacious start at Trailhead Brewery when Elaine paid $7.50 for 
    	two beers.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter Laura perused the menu and 
    	noticed nachos were $9.00.&nbsp; A quick vote was taken and it was 
    	decided to relocate the meeting to a more suitable (cheaper) 
    	establishment.&nbsp; SidePockets was decided upon and calls were 
    	made to the remaining club members advising them of the change.
    	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 2px">&nbsp;</p>
    	<p >
    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    	Laura and Teresa were the first ones on the scene at SidePockets.&nbsp; 
    	Julie, Nancy, Fred and Elaine followed shortly thereafter where they 
    	found L &amp; T sitting at a nice long but narrow, high table, chugging 
    	beers and giggling like schoolgirls.&nbsp; What led up to their 
    	childish behavior remains a mystery. 
    	<p >&nbsp;</p>
    	<p >
    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    	Jeannette was the next to arrive wearing a long western style jeans 
    	jacket covering a white tee shirt with buttons up the sleeve and 
    	Jeannette jeans.&nbsp; Her hair and makeup were done to perfection 
    	and she came ready to eat.&nbsp; So ready in fact, that she brought 
    	a baggie with some sort of dog food looking salad munchies and a 
    	container of salad dressing in her purse.&nbsp; 
    	<p >&nbsp;</p>
    	<p >
    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    	Mark came next, looking dapper, but surely conflicted.&nbsp; Though 
    	he tried to hide it, those of us who know him best were certain he 
    	was torn between the love he has for his family and his obligation 
    	to the volleyball team.&nbsp;&nbsp; What to do, what to do?&nbsp; 
    	Luckily he was able to down a cold brew, instruct Fred on computer 
    	routing procedures and chat for a few minutes before kissing his 
    	beloved wife and bidding his family a fond adieu.&nbsp; 
    	<p >&nbsp;</p>
    	<p >
    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    	In record time, the bearded twin, AKA Matthew, reached destination 
    	SidePockets at 8:39 p.m., and settled in nicely for the evening.&nbsp; 
    	His delay was due to some work function, where in twin-like fashion 
    	he also had to make a heart retching decision between family and 
    	commitment.&nbsp; His choice to spend the bulk of the evening with 
    	his family paid off well, as evidenced later that night when his 
    	laugher curtailed his ability to speak to his younger brother.&nbsp; 
    	Though Elaine tried valiantly to take over and finish the 
    	conversation for him, she too experienced difficulty talking while 
    	tears of laughter rolled down her cheeks.&nbsp; This was taken as a 
    	sure sign that he had made the right choice.
    	
    	<p >&nbsp;</p>
    	<p >
    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    	Several culinary delights were shared by all including, but not 
    	limited to, potato skins, French fries, chicken nachos, regular 
    	nachos, fried mushrooms and chicken salad.&nbsp; These tempting 
    	morsels were washed down with iced tea, coca cola, our friend Bud 
    	Light and some strange malt concoction with varied degrees of brown 
    	colored beer (Fred�s choice).

    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    	During last night�s meeting of the minds decisions were made, 
    	surveys were taken and several random thoughts were expressed.&nbsp; 
    	Though too numerous and, in many cases, too minute and possibly too 
    	immature to relate, a summary of the highlighted topics is given 
    	below:
    	<p >&nbsp;</p>
    	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

    	taken to the hospital during a diarrhea bout.<br>
    	One sibling who has never had the condition did have a rather large 
    	tumor expressed from her insides many years ago.&nbsp; Is there a 
    	connection?

    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">No conclusion yet as to why the 
    	remaining sibling has never experienced this medical malfunction.&nbsp; 
    	Could it be perhaps that she is better at keeping things bottled up 
    	than the rest of us

    	although a reminder via e-mail should probably be sent out as well.&nbsp;

    	<span style="font-family: Tahoma">In searching for a name befitting 
    	our family club, many suggestions were thrown in the hat and many 
    	were tossed out.&nbsp; Everyone was in agreement that the name had 
    	to be both unique and meaningful to just us.&nbsp; A name that would 
    	bring fond memories of childhood, spark laughter in our hearts and 
    	fill us with a sense of family.&nbsp; After much deliberation and 
    	careful soul searching, it was decided that our newly formed club 
    	would be called The DBC.&nbsp; Henceforth, from this day on, the 
    	monthly meeting of the Sicking Siblings and Parents Club shall now 
    	and forever be known as the Dodie &amp; Bones Club, or The DBC for 
    	short.
