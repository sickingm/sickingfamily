		<td>&nbsp;<p>This non-official, irregular, ad hoc DBC meeting was called 
		for some very important reasons. They were as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>1. Regie was in town<br />
			2. Laura consented to a surprise 40th birthday party<br />
			3. As a venue for creating Jan’s 50th birthday card/greeting/movie<br />
			4. We wanted to.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<hr>
		<p class="minutes">Matt and Jeannette graciously hosted the impromptu meeting/celebration/workshop 
		at their Bridgeton MO estate, which quite comfortably accommodated 16 of 
		the members and two drop-in guests. Food was aplenty, the conversation lively, 
		and the SSFM, (Sicking Standard for Family Mocking) was enforced. Everyone 
		probably had an enjoyable evening, but since these minutes are 4 weeks late 
		in being transcribed, your seckitary either no longer remembers or cares.
		</p>
		<p class="minutes">As this was not a real meeting, there was no need to 
		call order, however because our chairperson is a Order Caller Extremist, 
		she needlessly banged the official gavel at 8:40, 8:50, 8:51 and several 
		other times during the course of the evening. No one listened, but banging 
		it made her happy, so we allowed her to bang to her heart’s content. (That’s 
		just the kind of people we are.) </p>
		<p class="minutes">A seasonal and very appropriate inspirational message 
		was delivered by Jelly B. Again, not necessary for a non-meeting, but since 
		it was educational in content we allowed this as well.</p>
		<p class="guru">“Many people don’t know that ordinary coral painted brown 
		and attached to the skull with wooden screws can make your child look like 
		a reindeer.” </p>
		<p class="minutes">
