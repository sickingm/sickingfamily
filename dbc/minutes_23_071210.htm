				<hr>
				Incredibly, this was the only DBC Meeting in 2007, after having held 22 official meetings during the previous 34 months.&nbsp; Unless 
				you count the River City Rascals Game in July, which I guess we should have, except nobody took minutes or anything for that event, so 
				we're considering it to be just a field trip, and not really a meeting.<p>All attendees arrived more or less on time, eager to resume 
				DBC-ness after such a long hiatus since our last meeting.&nbsp; Matt arrived last, accompanied by number three son Luke, and made up 
				for his tardiness by leaving early to take Luke to his basketball game.&nbsp; Upon returning at 9:15, he asked what he missed.&nbsp; 
				The unanimous response was &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>
				<p class="guru"><font size="2">Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, The DBC Inspirational Guru, Ms. Dixie McCall 
				Boobash forgot to bring an inspirational quote.&nbsp; We all left the meeting somewhat uninspired.</font></p>
				<p>The table at which we sat was long and thin.&nbsp; Matt at the tail end of the table had no idea what Nancy, Laura and Julie were 
				saying down there.&nbsp; I'm sure it was interesting (see note below), so the topics listed below cover but the smallest portion of 
				the entire gamut.</p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">Topics of Discussion:</span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We are not trading presents or ornaments for Christmas like last year</li>
					<li>Most everyone was relieved not to have to do the extra Christmas shopping, but Elaine looked visibly upset that she had to 
					abandon all hope of receiving a tampon-ornament like Laura got last year.</li>
					<li>We ordered an awful lot of mushrooms</li>
					<li>Matt's twenty dollar bill got a lot of hot sauce on it from Mark slopping around his wings</li>
					<li>Elaine still hates her job, and plans on tendering some sort of ultimatum to her superiors at work soon.&nbsp; (There was a 
					date that she had to wait for before so doing, but it was unclear exactly why.)&nbsp; </li>
					<li>(By &quot;unclear&quot; I mean Elaine explained it in complete detail, but I forgot.)</li>
					<li>Mary Godfrey was at the bar and said hello to us, and hugged Clare and Matt.</li>
					<li>(Marry was probably nostalgic for the good old days when Clare and Matt would overdraw their bank accounts.)</li>
					<li>
						&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<p class=minutes style="text-indent: 0in">Please email Matt or Elaine with other items of note and interest from this meeting.&nbsp; 
				These minutes are looking pretty miserable.</p>
			<p class=signature>
				- Respectfully Submitted<br>
				this 11th day of December, 2007<br>
				By Mungo Sickis<br>
				on behalf of <br>
				Alaine Inaz Sharkaway Macaroni,
				Seckitary<br>
				On account of she's been really overworked lately.</p>
