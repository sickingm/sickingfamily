				<hr>
				The 1st meeting of the New Year was held at Rhino’s Sports Bar 
				and Grill in St. Peters, MO. Instead of the usual summary of 
				atmosphere, food and drinks I shall express my feelings for the 
				DBC and this month’s gathering in the following manner.
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">A long, long time 
				ago,<br>
				We can still remember<br>
				How that meeting made us smile<br>
				And we knew if we had the chance<br>
				We could make those toilets dance<br>
				And maybe they'd be happy for a while </p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">But January made us 
				shiver<br>
				With each appetizer they'd deliver<br>
				Half priced food until 7:00<br>
				Half priced food seemed like heaven </p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">We can't remember if 
				we cried<br>
				When we heard Bob Lindhoff lied<br>
				But something funny filled us all with pride<br>
				The day the eggnog died </p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">So No fear, DBC time 
				is here<br>
				All the winos went to Rhinos<br>
				Cause Rhinos has good beer<br>
				And Nance &amp; Matt were drinkin' Pepsi in the rear<br>
				Singin’ boy we wish we liked that beer <br>
				Boy we wish we liked that beer </p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">Did you write the 
				notes all night<br>
				And have they ever shed some light<br>
				If the minutes tell you so<br>
				Do the polls confound what you knew<br>
				Can you take them with you in the loo<br>
				And can you read them if you wipe real slow. </p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">And we know that 
				you're a member well<br>
				Cause we saw your badge as you fell<br>
				We laughed at all your moans <br>
				Man, we dig those dodie and bones </p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">We were just a bunch 
				of siblings who<br>
				Never talked much or even knew<br>
				All our bathroom jokes were out of luck<br>
				The day the club was formed...<br>
				<br>
				</p>
				<p class="guru" style="text-align: center">We started singin’<br>
				No fear, DBC time is near<br>
				All the winos went to Rhinos<br>
				Cause Rhinos has good beer<br>
				And Nance &amp; Matt were drinkin’ Pepsi in the rear<br>
				Singin' boy we wish we liked that beer<br>
				Boy we wish we liked that beer</p>
				<p>And so it goes.... </p>
				<p>Mark, being back in volleyball frenzy was unable to attend, 
				but somehow we managed to carry on without him. The meeting was 
				called to order at 8:05, and then three more times after that. 
				Once it was called on a beer bucket. We can’t be sure, but we 
				believe it took and the meeting was official. What we can be 
				sure of is that Julie’s inspirational message was up to par 
				again this month.</p>
				<p class="guru">&quot;If I lived back in the Wild West days, instead 
				of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I’d carry a soldering iron. 
				That way if some smart aleck-y cowboy said something like, “Hey 
				look, he’s carrying a soldering iron” and started laughing and 
				everybody else started laughing, I could just say “That’s right, 
				it’s a soldering iron...The soldering iron of justice.” Then 
				everybody would get real quiet and ashamed because they made fun 
				of the soldering iron of justice. Then I would probably hit them 
				up for a free drink.&quot;</p>
				<p>Thank you, thank you, Julie B. </p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">Topics of Discussion:</span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Clare is the queen of the DBC with her new necklace</li>
					<li>
						Everyone is jealous of Clare’s necklace</li>
					<li>
						Why didn’t Clare get a necklace like that for each of us</li>
					<li>
						Clare is hoggish with her necklace</li>
					<li>
						Mark W is talking about Teresa’s bottom and Elaine’s top</li>
					<li>
						Best story: Teresa spotted a rainbow maker stuck on 
						Jeannette’s window and inquired where it came from. 
						Jeannette replied that Matt had given it to her. Teresa 
						laughed and said that she had received an identical one 
						from Mark as well.</li>
					<li>
						That truly was the best story ever.</li>
					<li>
						Fred is getting on the DBC bandwagon</li>
					<li>
						Matt brings his MP3 player, which has books on tape with 
						him at his office when he goes to the bathroom at work. 
						Problem is, he has no place to set it. He has 
						ingeniously solved this problem by pulling his drawers 
						down only to his knees, thereby creating a table of 
						sorts between his legs, and placing the MP3 player there 
						while he goes. Just goes to show what a Wash U. 
						education can do for a person.</li>
					<li>
						Clare went and got some PRID from the pharmacist for her 
						abyss. (See minutes from meeting 11B). Fluid has been 
						drawn, but abyss is still there.<br>
						Clare believes the core (or sack) is still there<br>
						Word of caution: Beware of Clare’s back at family 
						functions.</li>
					<li>
						Jen followed Nancy home from Mom’s house</li>
					<li>
						Nance is a bad Grancy. She didn’t have a present for 
						Danny yet.</li>
					<li>
						Mark W. wants to know what will be written about him in 
						the minutes. We promise not to write anything about him.</li>
					<li>
						Mark W. went to the doctor one time to have an abyss 
						removed from his stomach.</li>
					<li>
						Abysses run rampant at the Wilhlem home front.</li>
					<li>
						Matt saw a pen at the CFM that he didn’t buy for Elaine. 
						It had a lady on it whose clothes fell off when you 
						turned it just like the one Mr. McMullin had and similar 
						to Dad’s old pipe.</li>
					<li>
						Mark W. made a suggestion about feeding mayonnaise to 
						live tuna, so it would be easier to make tuna fish 
						sandwiches.</li>
					<li>
						Clare had heard that before</li>
					<li>
						Tuna fish are giant. How do they fit them in the cans?</li>
					<li>
						Matt is right. Mark W. is wrong.</li>
					<li>
						Rick Moranas</li>
					<li>
						Laura is playing a game up at the bar</li>
					<li>
						Mark W sits corrected.</li>
					<li>
						Nancy stole Dad’s leather notebook</li>
					<li>
						Matt Gaveled</li>
					<li>
						Nancy is excused</li>
					<li>
						All the old DBC members need magnifying glasses.</li>
					<li>
						Katie is 27 and can still do cartwheels.</li>
					<li>
						Sniglet</li>
					<li>
						Overall gym suit – wrestling match</li>
					<li>
						Clare is on drugs</li>
					<li>
						Ricky Hardin is a poet</li>
					<li>
						Fred arrived at 7:15 on the toilet dot</li>
					<li>
						Laura has changed seats</li>
					<li>
						Doesn’t Laura like the person she was sitting next to?</li>
					<li>
						Matt brought treats. All Sorts.
					</li>
					<li>
						You have to be careful of All Sorts due to hidden 
						coconut.</li>
					<li>
						The price of cocoa is going up because Ivory Coast 
						Pirates are attacking ships</li>
					<li>
						I love fondant.</li>
					<li>
						Laura must have bees in her bonnet because she cannot 
						sit still and leaves the table. Sometimes Teresa goes 
						with her.</li>
					<li>
						Jeannette is showing something purple. Matt thinks it’s 
						cool.</li>
					<li>
						When Julie is done eating, she will talk to us.</li>
					<li>
						Julie had diarrhea in the confessional</li>
					<li>
						Is there anywhere that Julie hasn’t had diarrhea?</li>
					<li>
						Teresa had to finish tall Linda’s confession when she 
						abruptly left the confessional and the priest didn’t 
						realize he had a new customer</li>
					<li>
						Julie went to confession in the boy’s bathroom on her 
						wedding day</li>
					<li>
						Laura’s cat needed some attention in high school</li>
					<li>
						Fred kept his jacket on during the meeting</li>
					<li>
						Teresa is wearing a lime green sweater</li>
					<li>
						Nancy is wearing a sweater and listening to Julie</li>
					<li>
						Mark W. loves Nellie and is going to his bar opening in 
						Hazelwood.</li>
					<li>
						Nellie will be naming his bar after Andy (Mac’s)</li>
					<li>
						Not too easy tonight. Didn’t take.</li>
					<li>
						Clare screamed at Mary and broke a blood vessel.</li>
					<li>
						No loud music. We are old, but not as old as Nancy.</li>
					<li>
						Mark W. is making hand signals and wondering what I am 
						writing.
					</li>
					<li>
						Matt has a book of quotes. He is wondering what I am 
						writing as well, but I am not going to tell him.</li>
					<li>
						Matt bought us all scratch off tickets.&nbsp; <span class='ed'>&lt;&lt;Actually 
						Laura paid for half -- ed.&gt;&gt; </span>
					</li>
					<li>
						Matt is a good boy.</li>
					<li>
						None of us won.</li>
					<li>
						Matt wasted his money.</li>
					<li>
						TOO LOUD!</li>
					<li>
						Drink up. No bottles, no to-to cups.</li>
					<li>
						Change of venue – Laura’s house.&nbsp;</li>
