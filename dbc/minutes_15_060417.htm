				<hr>
				<p>The 15th meeting of the Dodie and Bones Club was held at 
				Parrots Bar and Grill conveniently located in the grand old city 
				of St. Peters, MO. This establishment was especially convenient 
				for Elaine, Laura and Jen who all lived within a 2.5 mile 
				radius. It was also pretty convenient for Nancy, Fred, Mark and 
				Teresa. Relatively speaking, Parrots was convenient for Matt, 
				Jeannette, Mark W &amp; Clare as well. But once again, it was not so 
				convenient and a bit of a trek for our South St. Louisan Julie 
				B. Oh Jelly, why must you always be different? </p>
				<p class="ed" align="right">....and it was really, really, 
				really inconvenient for Regie, Paul, and Janet<br>
				---ed.</p>
				<p>Once we were conveniently situated on the second floor of 
				this fine eatery we ordered and then consumed a plethora of 
				appetizers, sandwiches, salad and drinks. (All of which tasted 
				mighty fine to me.) </p>
				<p>Nancy gaveled at 8:31:47 and tried to bring about some 
				semblance of order. We pretended to be impressed by her 
				authority and politely settled down enough to appease her. 
				Having satisfied her craving for power the 15th DBC meeting had 
				begun.<br>
				</p>
				<p>Mark, our sergeant at arms, was so busy entertaining everyone 
				by playing the air guitar and singing some of his favorite rock 
				tunes that we nearly forgot the inspirational message 
				recitation. Had it not been for one of the other members' 
				attention to order and protocol the following words of wisdom 
				delivered by Jelly B would have been lost forever:</p>
				<p class="guru">&quot;I think in one of my previous lives I was a 
				mighty queen, because I like everyone to do what I say.&quot;</p>
				<p>Clare has added one more line to Julie’s message:</p>
				<p class="guru">“Like not inviting Clare to breakfast.”<br>
				</p>
				<p>And now for something completely different......It should be 
				reported that at this month’s meeting your seckitary abstained 
				from all forms of minute taking. That grave responsibility was 
				left up to any and all members who were willing to try their 
				hand at this necessary but somewhat cumbersome function. Let’s 
				see how they did shall we?</p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">Chip Off the Block Wilhlem Minutes 
				- 8:30 pm:</span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&nbsp;Poor Clare, who has to work too hard, finally got 
					a vacation day and was purposely excluded from the Harrah’s 
					breakfast excursion this morning.</li>
					<li>They deserve no candy</li>
					<li>Elaine has a phlegm bag</li>
					<li>Nancy gaveled the meeting to order at 8:31:47 – toilet 
					time</li>
					<li>Elaine won’t do the minutes but insists on the 
					minute-taker doing things her way.</li>
					<li>Julie has a cold &amp; snot is running down her face. </li>
					<li>She deserves it for not wanting me to attend the 
					breakfast festivities.</li>
					<li>Matt is passing around ginormous onion rings</li>
					<li>Nancy is trying to talk, but no one is listening much</li>
					<li>I’m taking notes on the backside of this paper; I wonder 
					how long before Elaine objects to this practice?</li>
					<li>Bar Mitzvah’s $2,500</li>
					<li>60th Anniversary – Rend Lake Vacation</li>
					<li>Major protocol error – no one asked for an Inspirational 
					Guru message. </li>
					<li>Matt is having all 7 of his kids Bar Mitzvahed next 
					Saturday.</li>
					<li>This pen just exploded, but I put it back together</li>
					<li>Elaine makes a suggestion for Dad’s birthday present.
					</li>
					<li>The Three Stooges are doing fascia &amp; soffits at Matt &amp; 
					Jeannette’s house. It will take 2 weeks. They started March 
					1 and are almost done. The gutter guards do a good job of 
					keeping both the leaves and the water out of the gutters.</li>
					<li>Elaine’s hand is still up but everyone (except me) is 
					ignoring her</li>
					<li>Elaine didn’t get to go to breakfast this morning 
					either, but at least she was invited.</li>
					<li>Did I mention that I didn’t get invited to breakfast 
					today?</li>
					<li>Nancy thinks Elaine is twice as good as she (Nancy) is. 
					I think it has something to do with lawn mowers.</li>
					<li>Laura’s boss is named Marty. He was at a call doing 
					paramedic duty &amp; Elaine yelled over to him to thank him for 
					something (lawn mowers?) while he was busy trying to save 
					lives. If all her neighbors die off, it will be all Elaine’s 
					fault.</li>
					<li>Nancy heard her name mentioned</li>
					<li>“Did you get the moon pie?”</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Alrighty 
				then.&nbsp; Thank you Clare D. Wilhlem for taking these fine notes.&nbsp; 
				(Maybe it’s just me but I get the subtle feeling that Clare may 
				be a bit miffed due to the breakfast exclusion gaffe.)</span></p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">Now, minutes by Mungo Sickis - 8:52 
				pm:</span> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Discussion on new ballpark memorial brick – makes us 
					sound like we are fat</li>
					<li>Lots of conversation going on at the east end of the 
					table, but I can’t hear</li>
					<li>Julie left early being mortified for not inviting Clare 
					to breakfast this morning</li>
					<li>Elaine just scratched the back of her neck. Perhaps she 
					has scabies. </li>
					<li>I sure hope Elaine doesn’t have Scrofula or leprosy or, 
					heaven forbid, the heartbreak of psoriasis.</li>
					<li>Elaine has ceased scratching</li>
					<li>Mark W. has 50 cents.</li>
					<li>Mark &amp; Fred want to play darts</li>
					<li>Mark W is leaving in disgust. He will be going to bed 
					after going dodie.</li>
					<li>Matt’s brain is totally cluttered like an old attic.&nbsp; 
					(I thought she said &quot;addict&quot;.</li>

					<li>Laura discussing Rend Lake</li>
					<li>Maybe we should all get our picture taken in really old 
					fashioned clothing. </li>
					<li>Maybe not.</li>
					<li>Elaine and Laura are not communicating effectively.</li>
					<li>No one is talking to Elaine or to Mark. Probably because 
					they aren’t being funny.</li>
					<li>Mom wants Dad to stay away from dancing girl. (But only 
					at the Casino.)</li>
					<li>There is moisture on the notebook – but Elaine says it’s

					<li>Too loud</li>
					<li>Elaine can’t count money</li>
					<li>Toilet time is wrong</li>
					<li>Jeannette does not have money in her pants </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Hmmmm. Concise yet insightful. Thanks Laura. </p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">Now minutes by Slots Machine Lloyd 
				– 9:40 p.m.</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Waitress gets a fine tip for her cheerful stair-stepping 
					service</li>
					<li>Matt eats the last Good ‘N Plenty</li>
					<li>Elaine calls for “QUIET”</li>
					<li>Laura and Teresa keep passing money around</li>
					<li>Jeannette sits on her chair backwards</li>
					<li>Matt doesn’t remember to race his chair tonight</li>
					<li>Mark wants Fred to sing Karaoke.</li>
					<li>Fred refuses again – perhaps he is too shy.</li>
					<li>Quinn and Maggie go bar-hopping during their spring 
					break</li>
					<li>Clare leaves with the beer money</li>
					<li>Mark only sings Karaoke in Japan</li>
					<li>Elaine is going to Mexico to investigate the liquor

					<li>A moment of silence ensues </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Thank you Nance. You truly have captured the essence of who 
				we are. </p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">And finally, as the closing minute 
				taker, I AM TERESA!<br>
				10:00 p.m.</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Why em see eh?</li>
					<li>This is a nice pen, but a dumb song – YMCA</li>
					<li>Laura is watching a movie, which is really music – If 
					you can call it that.</li>
					<li>Maggie’s having SOTB (a drink forced on her by Laura.)</li>
					<li>Jeannette wants to sing Oklahoma</li>
					<li>Matt performs Evita from the balcony</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ed" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In all 
				actuality it, it was only a few bars from the balcony scene - 
				&quot;Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.&quot;&nbsp; Not the entire musical.&nbsp; 
				That would have been inappropriate.</p>
				<p class="ed" align="right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
				-- ed.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Teresa is unable to take notes </li>
					<li>Jen, Jeannette &amp; Matt all have some of Maggie’s SOTB 
					drink.</li>
					<li>Nancy also partakes in the beach drink</li>
					<li>Teresa likes having SOTB with a straw</li>
					<li>Our waitress does not have a belly button</li>
					<li>Elaine’s cocaine usage becomes apparent – her nostril 
					has white powder in it (Or could it be from the Good ‘N 
					Plenty she previously shoved up there?)</li>
					<li>Fred will sing only for money </li>
					<li>There’s not enough money on the table to make Fred sing</li>
					<li>Matt &amp; Elaine perform Joe Cocker renditions</li>
					<li>Mark is hip</li>
					<li>Mark plays all alone and does not “self-monitor”</li>
					<li>Fred is left handed</li>
					<li>Cardinals win again</li>
					<li>Elaine has great hand movements but I cannot hear her</li>
					<li>Matt tries to technically explain about the Luminator 
					Website so we stop listening.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Nice job of observing and recording your surroundings Teresa.</p>
				<p>And there you have it. The minutes conclude at 10:25 p.m. and 
				the 15th DBC meeting probably ended some time after that. </p>
				<p>As your seckitary I would like to extend my gratitude to each 
				of you who stepped up to the plate for me this month. Not only 
				did I get a well deserved break from the tedious and thankless 
				job of minute taking, but my name got mentioned many more times 
				than if I had been taking the notes myself. For that I am 
				grateful. </p>
				<p>Matt will arrange for the May 2006 meeting. </p>
