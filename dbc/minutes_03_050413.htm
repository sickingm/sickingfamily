				<p align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">This meeting was held in a 
				more formal setting. Members sat around a very large rectangular 
				table which didn’t lend itself to group conversation, and as 
				such there was no club business attended to. However, for the 
				benefit of those who couldn’t attend, following is a recap of 
				the evening from your seckitary’s perspective – </span></p>
				<p  align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Laura, Andy, Katie and Elaine 
				were the first to arrive and began to scope out a gathering 
				area. After much discussion, Elaine got her way and we huddled 
				at a very nice marble topped table. While waiting for others to 
				arrive, Laura modeled her new vacation belt, which depicted 
				scenes from various tourist spots across the nation. We also 
				learned that no Mimi’s Cafe in the United States serves hard 
				liquor - beer and wine only. Sorry Mom. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Julie and Katie would have 
				been there as well, but Julie was lost in the strip store 
				parking lot and couldn’t find Mimi’s house with the roof. After 
				much ado and several attempts at directing her in via cell 
				phone, she located the establishment and settled down with her 
				friend, Bud Light. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Clare, Mom, Dad, Katie, and 
				Mark W. followed shortly thereafter. Clare was still in her 
				neutral colors mood and wore a lovely tan suede blazer. Mark W. 
				was kind enough to buy a round of drinks before dinner to which 
				several of us owe him a big thank you. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Dad came hungry and reminisced 
				about the French Dip Sandwich he had the last time he was at 
				Mimi’s. It must have been a mighty fine sandwich indeed, because 
				he ordered the same fare this evening and seemed to enjoy it 
				once again. As a side note, he refused to taste my honey dipped 
				oat muffin and by doing so, missed out on a culinary delight.
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Mom seemed exceptionally small 
				seated at our massive table, but what she lacked in size, she 
				made up for in personality. Once she got over her no hard liquor 
				disappointment she gamely joined in the festivities. I did 
				however see her bend down under the table, reach in her purse 
				and pull out a flask a time or two, but I’m sure that was just 
				the water she carries with her to quench her parched throat.
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Matt, Katie &amp; Jeannette 
				sauntered in high style wearing matching white pants and black 
				shirts. Jeannette won the fashion prize as her accessories 
				coordinated much nicer than the ones that Matt chose. As a 
				matter of fact, Matt’s necklace and bracelet actually clashed 
				with his attire. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Nancy and Katie were the last 
				to arrive. Nancy was right on time for the 7:30 reservation. 
				There was some discrepancy over whether the meeting time was 
				7:00 or 7:30 and Nance was concerned we changed the time without 
				telling her. Again I repeat, no, the time was not changed, we 
				just never had it right. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Everyone then got down to the 
				business of eating, which was done in abundance. Several 
				appetizers, soups, salads, bread and main dishes were consumed. 
				For dessert one slice of Key lime pie was shared by all. 
				Afterwards, being ready to burst I left for home and sweatpants. 
				(For events after my departure, please see remaining members.)
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">
				+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|
				<i><font size="2"><br>
				(Items between these |+|+ signs are from Matt who, unlike Madame 
				Sekitary, stayed until the last.) </font></i></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">After Elaine, Katie and Andy 
				left, Mom, Katie and Dad went to the rest room – presumably for 
				a nice rest. While they were gone Mark W. and Katie went outside 
				and gallantly fetched the car for his bride, Katie, Mom and Dad. 
				Nancy, Julie, Katie, Jeannette, and Matt stuck around for about 
				a half hour talking about stuff that Matt mostly didn’t follow.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Like this long story about 
				some old dress that Julie had that was white with little sparkly 
				dots on it where the dots were far apart at the top and then got 
				closer together at the bottom (or maybe it was the other way 
				around). But the dress, having been stored away for a long time 
				(I think it was like from Julie’s prom, or maybe a girl scout 
				festival in days past) looked not yellow, but some other color 
				that was definitely not white. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">So Julie and Katie used soap, 
				and Woolite, and Goop, and Mr. Clean and all kinds of cleaning 
				solutions on it to attempt to whiten the now 
				not-yellow-but-definitely-not-white dress. (In case this is 
				confusing let me clarify something here: Julie needed the dress 
				because one of her daughters – along with Katie - was either 
				making her first communion, or graduating from college, or 
				getting married, or becoming a nun or something – I didn’t 
				really hear that part but it didn’t seem to important to know 
				this in order to follow this cool story about sparkly dots and a 
				dress with a color that can’t be named by mere mortals.) </span>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Well (for those of you still 
				following this story) it turns out that the color just wouldn’t 
				let itself become a true white, but rather wanted to continue to 
				stay the same unnamable color that it now was (perhaps due to 
				the fact that it felt that there are a lot of white dresses – 
				with and without sparkly dots – but very few that are this 
				not-yellow-but-definitely-not-white color, because if there were 
				a lot of them surely someone from the Webster’s Unabridged staff 
				would have gotten around to inventing a name for it.) </span>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">So (and here comes the tragic 
				part of the story) Julie decided to use bleach on the dress (she 
				didn’t specify whether this was Chlorine Bleach or that other 
				kind of bleach that looks like soap powder, but I’m pretty sure 
				this isn’t germane to the story, so I won’t digress.) And 
				wouldn’t you know it, all the sparkly dots, which were the true 
				selling point of this dress (or maybe the selling point wasn’t 
				the dots themselves but the fact that they were sparkly dots 
				laid over this (formerly) white fabric – or maybe the selling 
				point was this curious distribution of the dots – close together 
				in one place and far apart in another. But I know that the dots 
				were involved in the selling point) turned yellow. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">I waited to find out if this 
				climax to the story was funny or sad by watching the reaction of 
				Nancy, Katie, and Jeannette, and decided it was one of those 
				hybrid 
				what-a-shame-but-lets-laugh-so-we-feel-better-about-your-sorrow 
				kind of climaxes, so I kind of laughed with a sad look in my 
				eyes and nobody seemed to think I was acting inappropriately. (I 
				certainly didn’t say anything stupid like “who cares about a 
				dumb old dress with a bunch of dots” or anything like that.)</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">And the waitress, who was 
				pointedly clearing off the table we were sitting at and 
				wondering when we’d ever leave said, “The same thing happened to 
				me.” </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Then Julie told this story 
				about this woman who fell asleep while Julie was telling her 
				that her baby was going to die. (She does a better job of 
				telling it than I do.&nbsp; You might want to ask her about it 
				yourself.) </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Then Katie, Nancy, Katie, 
				Jeannette, Julie, Katie, Matt, Katie, and Katie decided to leave 
				and talk out in the parking lot where it wasn’t so comfortable. 
				I snuck into the restroom first without telling anyone (I 
				thought Katie had seen me and would tell Jeannette where I was, 
				but I must have been mistaken abut that.) I just wanted to take 
				another quick look at the stainless steel trough-like sink in 
				the men’s room. </span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Then I went outside and got 
				the car and drove to the other side of the parking lot where 
				Katie and her mom and two aunts were talking. When I got there, 
				Katie was helping Nancy hold up this first communion dress on a 
				hangar that she had made (she made the dress - not the hangar) 
				and was apparently asking for some advice as to where to put 
				this strip of lace on it (under the belt, up the front, or 
				whatever).</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 2px" align="left">
				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Jeannette said leave it off, 
				and Julie agreed. Katie didn’t express her opinion – I guess she 
				didn’t want to upset her mom needlessly (whereas I’m sure that’s 
				exactly what Julie and Jeannette had in mind.) I opined that 
				what the dress really needed was some sparkly dots arranged in 
				some kind of unconventional and mesmerizing pattern. Then we 
				went home.

				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">There has been a suggestion

				<span style="font-family: Tahoma">Again, though many positions
