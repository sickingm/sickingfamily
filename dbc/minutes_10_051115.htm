				<hr>
				<p class=minutes>
					On the first really cold and blustery day of fall the DBC members ventured into the dark swirling winds of an Autumn 
					night to attend November’s meeting.  Just as Nancy, Laura, Jennifer Norton and yours truly arrived at Buffalo Wild 
					Wings we spotted Mark and some strange woman entering the building right ahead of us.  Why we wondered, was this 
					stranger waving to us and walking in such close proximity to our brother?  What would Teresa think?  Poor Teresa.  
					If only she had come to the meeting this month perhaps she could have usurped the interloper on our dear brother’s arm.
					We discussed several methods of distancing ourselves from this she-devil, but none would do.  She was sticking to him 
					like glue and seemed intent on joining us.  So knowing as we all do that politeness is to do and say the kindest things
					in the nicest way, we felt compelled to allow her to remain at Mark’s side.  This woman not only had bonded to our 
					oldest male sibling, but now also had access to the inner workings of the Dodie and Bones Club.  With trepidation and 
					heavy hearts, we forged on.  (Oh Teresa, why couldn’t you have been there?)
				</p>
				<p class=minutes>
					Buffalo Wild Wings proved to be a loud and boisterous establishment that was not conducive to pleasant conversation 
					and turned the simplest act of mockery into a yelling fest.  Snide comments and sarcastic observations were lost in 
					the deafening racket and relocation of the DBC meeting quickly became evident.  What was not so evident however, was 
					our waiter’s understanding of the situation.  Over and over we yelled that we couldn’t hear and would be leaving.  
					Over and over he tried to take our order.  One last time in unison we yelled “WE CAN’T HEAR!”  Finally and with some 
					embarrassment, our waiting apologized for not understanding, told us he was deaf and pointed out his hearing aid.    
					(We had one drink, tried the spicy shrimp and left him a good tip before moving on.)
				</p>
				<p class=minutes>
					Now seated comfortably in a private dining room of the much quieter Gas House Grill we settled down to await the 
					remaining members arrival.  Jeannette didn’t leave us hanging long and showed up at 7:45.  Fred followed shortly 
					thereafter and made his presence known at 8:07.   Julie prioritized, called short her school board meeting and 
					scrambled in at 8:45.  And finally one minute after Matt’s entrance at 9:05 the November DBC meeting was officially 
					called to order.  For reasons unknown it was called to order again at 9:07.
				</p>
				<p class=minutes>
					Julie then proceeded to inspire us with the following message:
				</p>
				<p class="guru">
					“I hope that if dogs ever take over the world and they choose a king, they don’t go just by size, because I think 
					there are probably a lot of Chihuahua’s with good ideas.”
				</p>
				<p class=minutes>
					Once again, Julie didn’t let us down and we marveled at her wisdom. 
					Formalities now having been taken care of, we embarked on our usual discussions pertaining to the state of the 
					union, political figureheads and global finance.  For those interested, highlights follow:
				</p>

					It is with great sadness that I must report no polls were taken at the November meeting.&nbsp; 
					Informative data collection of our personal habits will have to wait until December.&nbsp; Holiday planning took 
					precedence and used up this months’ allotted poll time. It was not for naught, however and the following 
					Christmas Eve decisions were made.
				</p>
				<p class="dbc-heading" style="margin-bottom: 0">CHRISTMAS EVE 2005</p>
				<ul style="margin-top: 0">
					<li>Will be held at the Lloyd’s Residence in beautiful St. Peters, MO</li>
					<li>Host and Hostess will provide accommodations only.  No food or drink, but toilet paper should be
					plentiful.</li>
					<li>Matt will bring half size pigs 'n blankets.  Enough for small children and adults alike.  
					Remaining St. Louis siblings will bring an appetizer and one dozen cookies.  Cost will be divided equally among
					sibs. in attendance.</li>
					<li>The placing of the child Jesus in the outdoor manger ceremony will be continued at the Lloyds. We 
					believe all the grandchildren have had a turn at this and we nominate Tori and Alex for this year’s 
					presentation.</li>
					<li>Check Sicking website for times and any additional information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="dbc-heading" style="margin-bottom: 0">Citation</p>
				<p class=minutes>
					Finally, mention must now be made of the failure to appear citation issued to Chip off the Block and Wally 
					Ball Wilhelm for carelessly ignoring repeated e-mails, messages and notifications regarding the November DBC 
					meeting. Ignorance is no excuse for the DBC law. Excuses of not receiving the e-mails, knowing the date of the 
					meeting or getting any calls regarding same is not just cause for absenteeism. Their actions will be taken up by 
					the DBC Quadrilateral Commission if in fact there were a Quadrilateral Commission which we all know there isn’t. 
					Or do we?
				</p>
				<p class="dbc-heading">Final Club Business</p>
				<p class="minutes">
					Next DBC meeting will be held on December 7, 2005 at Smokey Bones in Chesterfield.&nbsp; See Nancy and Fred 
					for details, or check the Events page on <a href="http://www.sickingfamily.com">www.sickingfamily.com</a>
