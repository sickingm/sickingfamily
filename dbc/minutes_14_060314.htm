				<hr>
				March winds blew the Sicking siblings to Sybergs Bar &amp; Grill for 
				the 14th meeting of the DBC. Nancy and Elaine were the first to 
				arrive followed shortly thereafter by some stranger who not only 
				sat at their table, but acted as if she were well acquainted and 
				belonged there. Nancy and Elaine exchanged sideways glances and 
				tried to politely ignore this intruder while she continued to 
				interject her opinions and freely set about joining in. Several 
				uncomfortable minutes ticked by when suddenly it hit us and we 
				realized this stranger was none other than our little sister 
				Julie. Let the minutes now show that due to the length of 
				David’s bathroom activities Julie didn’t have time to wear 
				makeup rendering her completely unrecognizable upon arrival. 
				Gratefully, Julie has since promised not to let David’s bowels 
				interfere with her personal grooming habits for future DBC 
				meetings.<p>Laura and Jen checked in at 7:10 with Jeannette in 
				tow a few moments later. Mark W and She Who Must Not Be Named 
				arrived by 7:23, but members were kept waiting until 8:55 for 
				Matt. The meeting probably was called to order at some point, 
				but there is no record of it, so its validity remains 
				questionable.</p>
				<p>Mgus and I am Teresa! who originally planned on attending 
				were delayed by Marianne’s Ring Day ceremonies and consequently 
				forgot to show up. It pains your seckitary to report that their 
				lapse in good judgment set the tone for the entire evening and 
				despite valiant efforts, the meeting was not what you would call 
				“top drawer”. The high standards from which the Dodie &amp; Bones 
				Club was founded were not invoked, acknowledged or carried out. 
				Mocking was held to a minimum, boisterous interruptions were 
				few, and rudeness did not prevail. Still in all we were away 
				from kids, homework and laundry and for that we were grateful.</p>
				<p>Following is the inspirational message delivered at 9:56 p.m. 
				by our very own Julie B:</p>
				<p class="guru">&quot;You know what would make a good story? 
				Something about a clown who makes people happy, but inside he's 
				real sad. Also, he has severe diarrhea.&quot;</p>
				<p>Thank you, Julie </p>

				proper lyrics, in this case,&nbsp; are &quot;I'm a lumberjack, and 
				I'm okay.&nbsp; I sleep all night, and I work all day.&quot;&nbsp; Or 
				is it possible that the intent was to inject humor by including 
				misquotes or a pastiche.&nbsp; Or, perhaps even, Alane is poking 
				fun at someone at the meeting who, sadly, did not know the 
				correct lyrics to this famed ditty.&nbsp; But, what the heck, I

				<p class="ed">(Editor's quandary here: Alane, I believe, meant 
				to say &quot;hoosiers&quot; here.&nbsp; But maybe she meant to say &quot;hoser&quot;.&nbsp; 
				It's also remotely possible that she invented a nonce word 
				&quot;hosier&quot;&nbsp; to cleverly invoke both concepts in one 
				utterance.&nbsp; I'll assume the latter since it makes my little
