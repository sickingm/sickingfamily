				<hr>
				We sat in this old smoky bar and ate mushrooms and some other 
				food.<p>The menu was hanging on the wall.</p>
				<p>Somebody - Mark Wilhelm - ate a grilled cheese sandwich.&nbsp; 
				(Or was it q Rueben).</p>
				<p>A gentle of somewhat buff physique was approached by Elaine 
				or perhaps Julie and asked if he played football. He said he 
				used to.&nbsp; They asked a personal question, the gist of which 
				I forget.&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; Was snickered a couple of 
				times, as well.</p>
				<p>We discussed Christmas gifts, and exchanged names in a very 
				professional manner.&nbsp; There was supposedly some good luck 
				or other mystical properties associated with the order the 
				drawing of the names, but I'm too old to remember what they were.</p>
				<p>Julie gave the following guru quote</p>
				<p class="guru">&quot;I didn't prepare a guru quote for today.&quot;</p>
				<p>(Sort of a Zen quote this time, huh?)</p>
				<p>Matt went to the bathroom a couple of times wherein he made 
				use of one of those old-fashioned trough style urinals.&nbsp; 
				But he never got around to mentioning the troughs to anyone, so 
				the girls were blissfully unaware of this anachronism.</p>
				<p>Then we decided it was too smoky/loud/expensive/smelly at the 
				Village Inn and decided to go elsewhere.&nbsp; A nice place was 
				found across the street.&nbsp; Matt go lost and went all the way 
				to Kirkwood or Maplewood or Hollywood or thereabouts before 
				deciding to call his siblings.</p>
				<p>Upon arriving at the new venue, Matt was delighted to note 
				that his siblings had decided upon a bar that was not so smoky/ 
				noisy/expensive/smelly.</p>
				<p>We got a bunch of gum and Ike&amp;Mikes from the gumball machine 
				and discussed those for a while.</p>
				<p>Matt brought in his laptop and decided to bore people with 
				some video.</p>
				<p><span class="dbc-heading">Topics of Discussion:</span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						&nbsp;Christmas ornaments</li>
					<li>
						&nbsp;Football and strange habits of football players.</li>
					<li>
						&nbsp;Some other stuff I forget.</li>
