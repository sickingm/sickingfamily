				<hr>
				<p>The 11th meeting of the Dodie and Bones Club was held at 
				Smokey Bones in Chesterfield MO. This aptly named, fine eating 
				establishment was chosen by none other than our esteemed 
				Chairperson, Nance “Slots Machine” Lloyd. With the exception of 
				our Texas jaunt to Dodie’s restaurant, Nancy surely wins the 
				prize for most appropriately named restaurant in which to hold a 
				Dodie and Bones meeting.</p>
				<p>
				Making up for their faux pas in missing the November meeting, 
				Mark and Clare were the first to arrive and scouted the area for 
				accommodations befitting our social club. Julie arrived next and 
				the three of them were comfortably seated when Matt, Jeannette, 
				Nancy, Laura, and Elaine along with our special guests, Jennifer 
				Norton and the renowned Lisa Hempin arrived. Remarkably 99% of 
				our attendees arrived on or about on time. </p>
				<p>
				Jeannette and Elaine didn’t care for the table situation and 
				tried to make changes to the arrangement, but others didn’t seem 
				inclined to get on that bandwagon. Jeannette and Elaine then sat 
				by themselves at a separate table in protest to the other 
				member’s insensitivity. Matt, knowing what’s good for him, 
				recognized the situation as a potential tear in his otherwise 
				happy blanket of home life, and decided to help with 
				reconfiguring the tables into a more socially conducive array. 
				Thusly, the tables were rearranged into a large square and we 
				were all happy campers again. The lesson to be learned here is 
				“Sometimes in life you have to take a separate table”. Either 
				that or “It’s always best in the long run to keep your wife 
				happy.”</p>
				<p>
				We then waited for Mark Sicking, who showed up a few minutes 
				later and wonder of wonders Teresa was there too! She had 
				finally deemed the DBC worthy and honored us with her presence. 
				We couldn’t believe our eyes. We were overcome with emotion and 
				humbled by both her stature and her beauty. Most of us managed 
				to regain composure long enough to rise to the occasion. We 
				first bowed and then lavished her with the praise and admiration 
				befitting royalty. Jeannette, who had never dreamed she would 
				actually one day meet Teresa was too stunned to speak. She 
				meekly kissed Teresa’s ring and lowered her head to offer up a 
				silent prayer of thanks to St. Cronin. </p>
				<p>
				And so we began. The meeting was called to order at 7:34, again 
				at 7:34½ and once more at 7:36. Feeling confident that order was 
				officially called this time we immediately proceeded to the 
				December inspirational message.</p>
				<p>
				Julie, having run 45 thousand car pool trips earlier that day 
				was left unprepared and relied on young David Bubash to provide 
				our meeting's muse. And here now for those who couldn’t be with 
				us at Smokey Bones, we present deep thoughts by David Bubash:</p>
				<p class="guru">
				&quot;In weightlifting, I don’t think sudden, uncontrollable 
				urination should automatically disqualify you.”</p>
				<p>
				(I think you would all agree that David’s future may well lie in 
				motivational speaking.)
				<br>
				For a few moments after the reading we became silent, lost in 
				thought, turning this over in our mind, meditatively and 
				inconclusively. We then hoisted a drink in David’s honor and 
				moved on.</p>

DBC members were polled tonight on where they stand while taking a shower.  
Supposedly some recent study conducted by a group of uniformed nitwits found 
that men face the showerhead and women turn away from it.  Our results are as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp; So it now appears that Matt, Julie and I (namely Alane) are the boys in the family.  Nancy, Clare, Laura, 
Jen, and Lisa are the girls and  we are uncertain what gender Mark S., Jeannette, and Mark W. are.</p>

Final Club Business:

Christmas Eve will be held at the Lloyds 12/24/05 @4:00 p.m.  Please enter your food offering on the 
&quot;Who’s Bringing What” section of the Sicking Family website

The Dodie’s Official T-Shirt is missing.  It was to be passed to the hosting member for each meeting 
but hasn’t been seen since October.  (We suspect Matt has it somewhere.)

Don’t forget to give Reg your slides over Christmas.  She will be scanning them onto photo album 
section of the website.  

January meeting date and place are as yet undecided.  Check website for updates.
