				<div class="poem">
				We was both brought up in St. Ann town, was me and Reg<br />
				And somehow the whole world seemed to frown, on me and Reg<br />
				In sports, we was never given the chance<br />
				To slide into home on the seat of our pants<br />
				We didn't dribble, shoot, score or even pass, that's me and Reg<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				But we grew up hearty and hale and strong, did me and Reg<br />
				We knowed every note of Mom's "Good Morning" song, did me and Reg<br />
				We knowed how Bev Linhoff liked to talk<br />
				Til our minds were numb and turned to chalk<br />
				And which of our sisters liked to sleepwalk, did me and Reg<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				We met Mrs. Klunk, just as most kids do, did me and Reg<br />
				She stole our balls and cussed a lot, at me and Reg<br />
				She treated us both alike, do you see<br />
				Whether screaming or ranting or raging you see<br />
				We was even up in the race do you see, that's me and Reg<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				We wanted to ask, but knew she'd say, "NO!!"<br />
				Her basement full of balls, she never would show, evil woman!<br />
				We left her then and I'm rather afraid that Reg cussed a little<br />
				We prayed that she'd live and she'd die a mean old widow<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				Then Reg grew up just as most girls do, but not with me<br />
				Over the highway she went to KSU, but not with me<br />
				She learned all about architecture things,<br />
				Designing gardens and artificial springs<br />
				She experienced all that college brings, but not with me<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				When she left for good, our hearts about broke, except for Matt's<br />
				'Scuse me please, but I sort of choke talking 'bout that<br />
				I thought of how her hair did shine<br />
				Til her car passed over the county line<br />
				And I started to drink beer instead of wine, just like that<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				And I stayed on and on, I do declare- but not with Reg<br />
				Was given a bed, I didn't share, not even with Reg<br />
				And there was room in the house when we walked about<br />
				Pets in the house were given some clout<br />
				I got more closet space, no doubt, because of Reg<br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				She was quite a girl in that St. Ann place where she left me<br />
				We talked of her often, her smiling face and how she drank tea<br />
				She's turning fifty soon, I said<br />
				Let's celebrate, paint the town red<br />
				We'll take a road trip, if we can find a bed, the whole DBC <br />
				&nbsp;<br />
				We went to Texas one bright day in September, to see Reg<br />
				We brought no presents you have to remember, to give to Reg<br />
				But when my turn came, for a poem<br />
				Her memory coming up fresh again, I called it "REG"
