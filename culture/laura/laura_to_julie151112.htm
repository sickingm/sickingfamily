        I called Julie today and recited the poem I invented</br>
        for this auspicious occasion, but thought I would share</br>
        it with everyone in case anyone wanted to have it printed</br>
        on a plaque or something.</br>
            </br>
            Ahem.......

                <p>
                Roses are red</br>
                Once my wallet got stolen</br>
                That no longer matters</br>
                Since clean is now your colon
                </p>
