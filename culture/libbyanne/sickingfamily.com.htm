						<p>	How clever are we on this webpage d'Sicking?<br />
						I went there today, and I just kept on clicking.</p>
											 
						<p>A photo, a poem, a DBC Minute:<br />
						We just needed Matt to help us begin it.</p>
											 
						<p>Sickingfamily.com, no if's, and's, or but's,<br />
						For Who Can Come When's and Who's Bringing What's.</p>	
											 
						<p>No doubt the site's fun, and who'd have suspected<br />
						The web was the way to keep us connected?</p>	
											 
						<p>Before through our pages he chooses to navigate,<br />
						The stranger who dares may wish to hestiate.</p>
						
						<p>Lest everyone think Sickings always disarming,<br />
						I feel quite compelled to offer a warning:</p>
												 
						<p>Gus, Mungo, Alane, Dixie, Miss Kitty,<br />
						None of the homepage pictures are pretty!</p>
