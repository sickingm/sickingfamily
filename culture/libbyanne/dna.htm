			<div class="poem">
				<p>Dean 'n' Amy were architects<br />
				Who lived on chromosome avenue.<br />
				They built the mansion for Mayor Nucleus<br />
				who told everybody what to do.</p>
				<p>They organized the organelles of the organism<br />
				and made sure everything went well.<br />
				When the lysosomes didn't want to take out the trash<br />
				They said, "That's your job, you organelles!"</p>
				<p>And endoplasmic reticula?&nbsp; Your name's tough<br />
				But we need two, one smooth, one rough.<br />
				The smooth one is the way for things to move around<br />
				And the rough one keeps the ribosomes in town,<br />
				The ribosomes in town, the ribosomes in town.<br />
				The rough one keeps the ribosomes in town.</p>
				<p>The ribosomes makes protein but what does protein do?<br />
				They help with digestion and keep us healthy, too.<br />
				Proteins have so many jobs, I can't name them all<br />
				But without these proteins this town would surely fall...apart</p>
				<p>The Golgi apparatus<br />
				Is never quite as fat as<br />
				The vacuoles who store up our supplies.<br />
				'Cause Golgi packs it all up,<br />
				And then he stacks it all up,<br />
				Everything that <b>WE</b> need to survive.</p>
				<p>Mitochodria's the power house that keeps this place a' runnin.'<br />
				And the sticky cytoplasm?&nbsp; It's the goo that we're all stuck in.<br />
				The cell membrane's the perfect place for us to end this ditty.<br />
				'Cause it's the skin<br />
				That holds in<br />
				Our entire city.</p>
