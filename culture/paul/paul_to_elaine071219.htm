						<p>There once was a beer-drinker named Elaine<br />
						Who was quite fond of hops and barley grain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After every Bud Light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try as she might<br />
						From having another she could not refrain.</p>
						<p>There once was a girl named Elaine<br />
						Who for skinny guys had great disdain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She liked her men large<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As big as a barge<br />
						Too bad she was too young for John Wayne. </p>
						<p>When Jinny started with her first labor pain<br />
						Amid the December snow and freezing rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &quot;This baby'll be funny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With disposition quite sunny.<br />
						So I think we should name her Elaine.&quot; </p>
						<p>There once was a girl named Elaine<br />
						Who made comments both funny &amp; insane.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &quot;To tell you the truth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might be uncouth,<br />
						But I gotta say whatever's in my brain.&quot; </p>
						<p>We have a cute sister named Elaine<br />
						Who is anything but a Plain Jane.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though she's 50<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sure looks nifty<br />
						And still will when she needs a walking cane. </p>
						<p>I'm sorry I can't be with you today<br />
						But there is something I just have to say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love you a lot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than even a tater tot<br />
						And there couldn't be a better sister, no way! </p>
