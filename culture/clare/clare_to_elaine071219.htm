			<p class="title">To Elaine, on Her Natal Anniversary</p>
			<div class="poem">
				<p align="left">Oh, our Lainey's turning fifty<br />
				And we think that's pretty nifty<br />
				And her brood wants her to know that she is great.<br />
				So Andy got a limo<br />
				And then Laura sent a memo<br />
				And the DBC showed up to celebrate.
				<br /><br />				
				Though we found no dancing midgets<br />
				(Lil' Rascal's Stymie called them "fidgets")<br />
				Nor did Yellow Pages show a Rent-a-Dwarf<br />
				Maggie brought food as her task<br />
				And Louie found some monkey masks<br />
				And I promise not to eat so much I barf.
				<br /><br />				
				Twice Elaine got me a prom date<br />
				Without her I never would rate<br />
				Come to think of it, I even wore her dress.<br />
				Though Jim never asked me out<br />
				Only two years did I pout<br />
				But we're here to toast Elaine, and I digress.
				<br /><br />				
				Our universes are colliding<br />
				Laine's free time went into hiding<br />
				And her new job seems to be just one big pain.<br />
				Still we'll raise our glass in toast<br />
				To our sister who's the most<br />
				As we shout our glad refrain, "We Love Elaine!"
