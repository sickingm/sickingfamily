						<p>Dearest Dad,<br />
							Please don't be mad.<br />
							I've not done Latin with my lad.<br />
							I would have done so if time I'd had.<br />
							Luke 18 keeps me busy - just a tad.<br />
							Now Luke's afraid that you'll be sad<br />
							Because his accent's really bad.<br />
							And I'm quite sure that you'll be glad<br />
							That though your class is really rad<br />
							We don't consider it just a fad.<br />
							I just didn't want him to forget to add<br />
							So I had to remove it from my lesson pad.</p>
