						The old couch in the youth room is all gooey<br />

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">I am pleased to announce 
that after many months of discussion, your mother has finally picked out and 
purchased a new couch for the living room.&nbsp; We got it at Carol House and she was 
able to pick out her own fabric to match the living room.&nbsp; Since it is a custom 
order, it will take 8-10 weeks until it is ready for delivery.&nbsp; They do not 
remove old furniture, so here is the question of the day----do any of you or any 
of your offspring want the old couch?&nbsp; If there is more than one application for 
ownership, I will decide the winner based on want and need.&nbsp; If a tie-breaker is 
needed, then there will be an essay contest.&nbsp; The subject will be &quot;Ode to my 
sister (or aunt) Laura.&nbsp; How her beauty, vast knowledge&nbsp;and general 
vivaciousness improves the quality of our daily lives.&quot;&nbsp; Minimum of 45 pages, 
single spaced.&nbsp; Good luck to all.</font></p>
