				'Twas the time before Christmas when all through the house<br />
				No one tried whining - not even her spouse.</p>
				<p>The garland was hung on the huge tree with care<br />
				"Don't touch it!" she'd say, and I didn't dare.</p>
				<p>There was so much to do, so she set up a trap<br />
				"If you're bored you can clean, or else take a nap!"</p>
				<p>I thought not of sugarplums - none danced in my head<br />
				What if rocks, sticks and onions were wrapped up instead?</p>
				<p>I'd been a good girl by most people's chatter<br />
				Although, it was true, there was one crucial matter.</p>
				<p>Away to the closet I flew like a flash<br />
				Tore open the door, gave my big toe a gash.</p>
				<p>There was my name, and beneath it did show<br />
				My good deeds were lacking, and soon she would know.</p>
				<p>I started to panic and tremble with fear,<br />
				For what could be done with Christmas so near?</p>
				<p>Could I make up for lost time? I had to think quick...<br />
				My plan was to "stimulate" our lil' Luke Nick. </p>
				<p>More rapid than eagles the ideas they came.<br />
				We strung beads, sorted colors and practiced each name:</p>
				<p>"Here's Adam, there's Lainey, this is Hanna and Beeb,<br />
				Here's Claire and here's Sammy, and the sign for 'good deed.'"</p>
				<p>To the top of the chart, and then, I'm sure I recall,<br />
				The good deed stickers spilled onto the wall.</p>
				<p>As I proudly looked over the great progress I'd made<br />
				Of onions and sticks, I was no longer afraid.</p>
				<p>I closed the closet door that had got me thus far<br />
				And was sure that, if anything, I'd just raised the bar.</p>
				<p>I looked all around at my sisters and bro's<br />
				Convinced that my gifts would have prevalent bows.</p>
				<p>Finally, at last, the long wait was done<br />
				Time for Grandma Jinny's, and time for some fun.</p>
				<p>Christmas was soon, as tonight was its Eve<br />
				But I learned something new as we tried to leave.</p>
				<p>There was the usual stress as we tried to get ready:<br />
				"Let's fix your hair. Damn it, hold your head steady!</p>
				<p>Don't run around, you're in your new dress!<br />
				Turn off that television! Don't you dare make a mess!</p>
				<p>I've worked so very hard, doesn't anyone care?<br />
				I want this to be nice, DON'T touch Luke's hair!"</p>
				<p>Let's pack up the car, get the presents and cookies,<br />
				We've done this before, don't act like you're rookies"</p>
				<p>We did as we were told, we didn't just sit<br />
				Or we knew she would say, "I'm so sick of this shit!"</p>
				<p>"LISTEN UP!" She exclaimed with a very stern brow.<br />
				It was then I became conscious of the thing I know now.</p>
				<p>Her speech was short-lived, her words were concise<br />
				"There will be no Christmas if you don't behave nice."</p>
				<p>Be good at Grandma's...that's all it took?<br />
				The very foundation of my world had been shook.</p>
				<p>I had worked so hard that it nearly made me sick<br />
				To think Santa would visit with just this one trick.</p>
				<p>Now that I'm older I'm sure she was right<br />
				As I scramble with children to prepare for our night.</p>
				<p>There are so many things that have to be done<br />
				And so many errands that have to be run.</p>
				<p>By the time Christmas comes no matter what anyone thinks<br />
				When dealing with in-laws there's no room for kinks.</p>
				<p>In fact, I'll admit that I too get crazed<br />
				My son recently looked at me slightly dazed.</p>
				<p>His concern came about this past holiday season<br />
				Christmas Eve had him baffled for the very same reason.</p>
				<p>He worked so hard to do good deeds every day<br />
				You can imagine his confusion when he heard me say:</p>
				<p>"We're going to Grandma's, so be good tonight<br />
				Happy Christmas to all, if you behave right!<br />
