				<p>This evening as we were trapped in the house watching the snow 
				fall, Faith wanted<br />
				to tell me a story and asked if I would type 
				it as she told it. So, I did. And now you<br />
				all get to enjoy it. Perhaps 
				you should all snuggle under your covers and read this<br />
				to your loved 
				ones...it's sure to be a family favorite. If only you could hear 
				the pride<br />
				in Aaron's voice as he reads this tale over and over to 
				all of us here knowing his<br />
				only daughter has just authored a masterpiece. <br /><br /><br />

				<p>Happy Birthday, Belle! Open this one, it has a necklace.

				and have hot chocolate!</p><p>	Now let's go play outside. I'm sweaty...let's go back inside.<br />
				Wait! There's more presents.
				</p><p>Hey! Let's go out and play in the woods. What's that light? I<br />
				smell a bunny. Um, how about we go play inside.
				</p><p>Hey sometimes you can sleep over at my house. How about we<br />
				call somebody? How about Ariel? </p>
