			<td><p class=title>An Ode to Dotted Swiss</p>
			<div class="poem">
			<p>For many years I was alone, <br />
			Surrounded by the boys. <br />
			I couldn't stand their stupid games, <br />
			And they hated all my toys.
			</p>
			<p>I started praying for a sister <br />
			And it took me 8 long years, <br />
			But finally God sent Regie <br />
			To dry my constant tears. 
			</p>
			<p>What a darling little sister! <br />
			As cute as she could be. <br />
			We shared a room but never clothes, <br />
			She was too small for me.
			</p>
			<p>Then while I wasn't looking <br />
			As often children do, <br />
			Regie started growing. <br />
			She grew and grew and grew.
			</p>
			<p>And then one day while browsing <br />
			Through our closet for a skirt, <br />
			The color pink just caught my eye. <br />
			Regie's brand new shirt!
			</p>
			<p>Dotted Swiss and pink it was <br />
			With roll-up sleeves to boot. <br />
			And dainty little buttons <br />
			Just made the whole thing cute.
			</p>
			<p>I took it out and tried it on. <br />
			It was as cute as it could be.<br />
			Oh, thank you so much Regie, <br />
			For lending it to me.
			</p>
			<p>Sometimes I would wear it <br />
			And sometimes Regie would. <br />
			But neither one could manage <br />
			To keep that blouse for good.
			</p>
			<p>When one would want to wear it, <br />
			The other had it on. <br />
			And if I ever slept too late, <br />
			You could bet the blouse was gone.
			</p>
			<p>One time I wrapped it up <br />
			And gave it as a gift <br />
			To Regie on her birthday <br />
			Just to see her spirits lift.
			</p>
			<p>But now the pretty thing is gone. <br />
			It no longer fit the bill. <br />
			The collar drooped, the buttons lost. <br />
			We gave it to Good Will.
			</p>
			<p>And now our Regie's 50. <br />
			And I am 58. <br />
			I thought another shirt to share <br />
			Would make her birthday great.
			</p>
			<p>I went to Joann's Fabrics <br />
			In search of Dotted Swiss. <br />
			I looked and looked and asked the girl <br />
			But all I found was this.
			</p>
			<p>A silly little present <br />
			With a theme for DBC <br />
			But if Mom should ever ask you, <br />
			It didn't come from me.
			</p>
			<p>It's just a little something <br />
			To make your birthday super <br />
			I bet you can't believe I found <br />
			A Reindeer Pocket Pooper
			</p>
			<p>But Reg- <br />
			If ever you feel gloomy <br />
			And want to conjure joy and bliss <br />
			Just remember all the happy days <br />
			We shared the Dotted Swiss.
