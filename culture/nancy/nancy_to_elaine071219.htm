						'Twas Elaine's birthday and all through the town<br />
						The people were shopping and running around; <br />
						Getting ready for Christmas and New Years to boot<br />
						Looking for bargains, collecting their loot.
						<p>But not all the Sickings, I know that it's true.<br />
						They gathered together with something better to do.<br />
						Elaine's birthday is special and calls for some fun,<br />
						So all went to Laura's and started on some. </p>
						<p>'Laine came home from work, then went to her door<br />
						With never a thought of what was in store.<br />
						She thought a nice dinner was all that was planned,<br />
						With Maggie and Shawn, Kev, Andy and Quinn. </p>
						<p>When what to her wondering eyes should appear,<br />
						But a big, long, sleek limo to be commandeered.<br />
						With a uniformed driver in white shirt and tie.<br />
						Surprised and astounded, Elaine cried, "Oh, my!" </p>
						<p>Elaine got her coat and put it on quick,<br />
						And jumped in the car, still fearing a trick.<br />
						But they went to the restaurant and went there in style.<br />
						A limo! A limo! All hers for a while! </p>
						<p>And while they were dining in splendor, it's true,<br />
						Her siblings snuck in - but to give them their due;<br />
						They just wanted to honor their sister so dear<br />
						With a party of sorts and, of course, lots of beer. </p>
						<p>After her dinner, she went back outside<br />
						Expecting her limo and an outstanding ride.<br />
						But her siblings were there, most all of them came<br />
						So she whistled and shouted and called them by name; </p>
						<p>"There's Julie and Nancy and Mark, Matt and Clare.<br />
						And Laura, by golly, but what do they wear?"<br />
						They all looked like monkeys with hats on their head.<br />
						Perhaps she was dreaming and still in her bed. </p>
						<p>Would they all disappear the moment she woke?<br />
						But no, it's most likely a DBC joke.<br />
						Even Regie and Paul found ways to be in it<br />
						So she settled right in to enjoy every minute </p>
						<p>A bottle of beer she held tight in her hand.<br />
						And she looked like a queen and felt really grand.<br />
						Fifty's not bad when all's said and done.<br />
						And she has a whole year till she turns 51. </p>
						<p>The party you know, by St. Cronin was blessed,<br />
						But I have to admit the limo's a mess.<br />
						The siblings went home but the memories remain.<br />
						'Cause basically speaking, we all love Elaine.</div>
