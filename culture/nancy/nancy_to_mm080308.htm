				<p class="title">Dear Mark and Matt:</p>
					<div class="poem">
						For your birthday poem<br />
						I'm sure you still wait, <br />
						So I have to say sorry <br />
						That I'm a day late.
						<p>I'd have a nice home <br />
						On the island of Fiji <br />
						If I could write verse <br />
						Like our sister, Regie. </p>
						<p>But I'm not a Shakespeare <br />
						Or even a Scott, <br />
						And I'm sorry to say <br />
						A poet, I'm not. </p>
						<p>But you have to admit <br />
						That my words are spelled right, <br />
						And to catch my real meaning <br />
						You needn't be bright. </p>
						<p>I want you to know <br />
						That I'm sending my wishes <br />
						For a sixtieth year <br />
						That's chock full of riches. </p>
						<p>So, with a wave of the flag <br />
						and a tip of the hat, <br />
						&quot;Happy Birthday,&quot; I say <br />
						To Mark and to Matt.</div>
