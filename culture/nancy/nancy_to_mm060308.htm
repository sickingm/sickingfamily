<p class=title>Happy Birthday</p>
<div class="poem">
At my desk all day I sat <br />
Scratching both my hair and hat <br />
Thinking all the while that <br />
This day is really feeling flat. <br />
Should be happy just to chat <br />
With a friend about the cat <br />
Who went outside to find a rat. <br />
But I couldn't do just that <br />
Because a pesky little gnat <br />
Kept on buzzing through the slat <br />
So I hit him with a bat. <br />
You should have heard that gnat go splat!<br />
But finally I remembered that <br />
I had to say to Mark and Matt<br />
Happy Birthday and all that.<br />
Now the day's not near so flat.<br />
Happy Birthday Mark and Matt!<br />

Er...If you don't mind a critique. &nbsp;I kind of like my <br />
ending better, even if I do lose top billing </font><br />

The gnat splat hit the vat so fat <br />
I could no longer knit or tat <br />
And so instead of all of that <br />
Happy Birthday, Matt and Mark</b></p>
