						Thank you, E., that was quite a pome.<br />
						I'll remember it till you get home. <br />
						And if the muse strikes you again, <br />
						Feel free to go and take a pen <br />
						And write more words of loving praise. <br />
						And send those words out my ways. <br />
						Or jeer about my ancient bones <br />
						Imortalized within your pones. <span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">
						<font size="2">[great rhyme!!] </font></span><br />
						But if you do, then I won't I whine <br />
						Cause I'm not old, I'm fifty-nine.
