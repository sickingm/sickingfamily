			<div class="poem">
                There once was a girl named Nance</br>
                Who thought she should just take the chance</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whack off her knee</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she could see</br>
                If her leg would now fit in her pants.
