					<div class="poem" style="width:8in;">
                        Dear Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help me to get along with my brother because I get mad at him easily and I know you already know that. I am wondering 
                        how you handle these temtashons? <span class="style1">(sic)</span>.&nbsp; How did you stop that storm a really long time ago? Did you like 
                        snap your finger or something? <br />
                        <br />
                        Love Macie&nbsp; <br />
