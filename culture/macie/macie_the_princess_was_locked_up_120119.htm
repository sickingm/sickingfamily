<p><i>Hi, Everyone,,</p><p>
Macie wrote a story tonight - well, dictated a story.  She called it <span class="title">The Princess was Locked Up.</span><br />
Maureen, if you read it to Faith, tell her to relax, that all is well in the end.  Here it goes:</i></p><br />
 
				<p class="title">The Princess was Locked Up</p>
					<div class="poem">
                    Once upon a time there was a princess locked in a castle.  <br />
                    There was a witch who locked her in there.  The princess's name was Betty.  <br />
                    The witch did not like her name.  When the princess was sleeping, the witch cursed Princess Betty.  <br />
                    The witch dared her to change her name to Evil Betty.  <br />
                    The princess changed  her name to Evil Betty, and she woke up being evil.  <br />
                    The princess's fingers turned ugly  and her nails were red and sharp.  <br />
                    The princess loved being evil and what she loved about being evil was her fingers and doing this:<br />
                    <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">
                        [insert here a gesture of an evil scrunched up face and fingers curled near your cheeks.]
                    </span></p>
                    <p>So, the witch kind of liked Evil Betty and so they were friends now.  <br />
                    So, the witch cursed Evil Betty back to being nice again and all the other cursed people back to being nice again. <br /> 
                    <p>The witch's heart got bigger and bigger and they lived happily ever after.<br /><br />
                    <p><p align="center"></p>The end.
