                    Sometimes I like to think.<br />
                    Sometimes I like to play.<br />
                    Sometimes I like to read.<br />
                    But now I'll just pray.<br /><br />
                    
                    God, thank you for the world;<br />
                    But sometimes it's a riot.<br />
                    Thank you for everything,<br />
                    But now I'll just be quiet.<br /><br />
                    Amen
