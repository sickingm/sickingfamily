						My brother Matt is known to you, <br />
						And also brother Paul.<br />
						And Mark, and all my sisters too, <br />
						Fine ladies, one and all.
						<p></p>
						<p>A fact that you may learn with mirth,<br />
						A fact Matt may not own, <br />
						Is when a sibling's birth- <br />
						Day comes around, he writes a poem. </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>He blossoms forth, creative juice <br />
						Osmoses from his brains. <br />
						He fairly drips with poetry <br />
						He oozes out quatrains. </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>On Sicking Family dot com <br />
						He slings verse any time <br />
						One celebrates a natal day; <br />
						No sibling's safe from rhyme. </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Your birthday's listed on our site <br />
						This 9th day of July <br />
						And yet no poem did Matthew write. <br />
						No posted ode. And why </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Should you be left without some verse <br />
						Created by our Matt? <br />
						Matt's been remiss and I would think <br />
						He'd be ashamed of that. </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Distinguished honorary bro' , <br />
						Please have a happy day. <br />
						And Matt, it's time to do your du-<br />
						Ty. Write one right away.
