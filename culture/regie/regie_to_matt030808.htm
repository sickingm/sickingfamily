					<div class="poem">
						The DBC, it meets at nicht <br />
						Wi muckle faught and din. <br />
						&quot;Oh quiet be, ye waukrife rogues, <br />
						Your broother's comin' in.&quot;
						<p>They niver heed a word I speak, <br />
						I try tae gie a froon, <br />
						And Clare, she cuffs them 'round the heid, <br />
						&quot;Ye Sickings, cuddle doon!&quot; </p>
						<p>Our Lainie wi' the poufy hair, <br />
						She leans 'gainst broother Pau' <br />
						Bangs up and cries, &quot;I want a beer!&quot;<br />
						The rascal starts them a'. </p>
						<p>Our Mark, he fetches brew and chips, <br />
						Jeannette, she serves them roun', <br />
						They hoist their bottles, an' I cry, <br />
						&quot;Noo, siblings, cuddle doon.&quot; </p>
						<p>But ere five minutes gang, our Nance <br />
						Cries oot twixt Laur' an' Jen, <br />
						&quot;The boats be open, let's awa'!"<br />
						An' Julie cries "I'm in!" </p>
						<p>But Teresa brings another round, <br />
						And Fred, he starts a tune, <br />
						Mark Wilhelm, John turn on the game, <br />
						&quot;Oh, drunkards, cuddle doon!&quot; </p>
						<p>At length they hear our Matthew's fit <br />
						An' he unbolts the lock, <br />
						They jump and yell "Surprise!" at him <br />
						"Gude birthday, Matt--and Mark!" </p>
						<p>&quot;An wha's this all aboot?&quot; he asks,<br />
						As he pits aff his coat. <br />
						&quot;The fun's been done," We siblings cry, <br />
						"We're off now for the boat."</div>
