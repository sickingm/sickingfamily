					<div class="poem">
						Hark! <br />
						What light through yonder window breaks? <br />
						'Tis the eighth, <br />
						And like to the Lark <br />
						At break of day arising <br />
						(Bird thou never wert) <br />
						On such a day we will our celebration keep according to thy birth. <br />
						Which bounteous gift wouldst thou in bounty cherish? <br />
						The ravin'd salt-sea<br />
						Shark? <br />
						The star to every wand'ring <br />
						Bark? <br />
						Perchance, the root of hemlock digg'd i' the <br />
						Dark? <br />
						On what stuff of mine hast thou <br />
						Embark'd?<br />
						A poem unlimited, <br />
						That is all, but I would fain write it once <br />
						You ask for whom we stand this special party?<br />
						For whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy? <br />
						For senior-junior, giant-dwarf? <br />
						O no! it is our ever fix&eacute;d <br />
						Mark.</div>
