			<p class=title>Thanks</p>
			<div class="poem">
			<p>I know that I shall never see <br />
			A birthday like you gave to me.</p>
			<p>Bestudded with surprise galore <br />
			And blackened 50th d&eacute;cor.</p>
			<p>Expecting only Lou &amp; E, <br />
			Soon finding Jay to make it three.</p>
			<p>Then Nance arrived in office door <br />
			To my surprise I found it four.</p>
			<p>Once home, I toured the girls around <br />
			My house, and Lo! What then I found!</p>
			<p>The doors burst open wide with flair <br />
			Admitting Mark and Matt and Clare</p>
			<p>And Teresa, Mark and Libby too, <br />
			With decorations, food and brew.</p>
			<p>By caravan, they faced the wrath <br />
			Of Rita, bearing down their path.</p>
			<p>But fearless they arrived in spite <br />
			Of dire predictions for the night.</p>
			<p>And so, courageous, knew no fear <br />
			And brought to me a party here.</p>
			<p>Next day, a steer gave up the ghost <br />
			So we could lunch on steak and toast. </p>
			<p>In churchyard, huddled close with fear, <br />
			We prayed return of Libby dear.</p>
			<p>Each vehicle we hailed, aghast,<br />
			As backward, forward, Libby passed.</p>
			<p>But then, who stopped at good St. Mike's <br />
			But Paul and Jan. I shouted "Yikes!"</p>
			<p>All siblings now accounted for <br />
			And Libby found, there were no more</p>
			<p>To wait upon, and so we hied <br />
			To Eldorado, southwest side.</p>
			<p>At Dodie's aptly named caf&eacute; <br />
			A new surprise was thrown our way.</p>
			<p>The foul tempest's evil blast <br />
			Had blown the power as it passed. </p>
			<p>Resourceful, in the restaurant's gloom, <br />
			Accepting not the party's doom</p>
			<p>Deciding, midst the Bud Light foam<br />
			To move the party to my home</p>
			<p>Not with defeated, mournful limp <br />
			But proudly bearing pounds of shrimp.</p>
			<p>And still the night brought more surprise. <br />
			It brought saltwater to my eyes</p>
			<p>As every sibling gave to me<br />
			A song, a poem, a parody.</p>
			<p>With offerings too, from O&amp;J<br />
			The ones we sorely missed that day.</p>
			<p>To Nancy, gaveling with will,<br />
			To Mark, the king of outdoor grill</p>
			<p>To Matt, who even rented car,<br />
			To Paul &amp; Jan, who came so far,</p>
			<p>To Clare and Mark, for great d&eacute;cor,<br />
			Including plastic ware d'or </p>
			<p>To Laine, who never spilled the beans <br />
			To Jay, our unknown keyboard queen </p>
			<p>To Laura, drummer without peer <br />
			To Teresa, saving pup from fear </p>
			<p>I offer to you all my thanks <br />
			I shed more tears into my hanks </p>
			<p>To O &amp; J and all of thee <br />
			I'm glad God gave you all to me. </p>
