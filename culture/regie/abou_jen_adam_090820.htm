						Jeannette 
						(and Adam - may their tribe increase!)<br />
						Awoke one night from peaceful sleep<br />
						And saw, bright as moonlight in her room,<br />
						Fifty-some candles dispelling the gloom,<br />
						And an angel writing in a book of gold.</p>
						<p>
						Our dear Jeannette is always bold,<br />
						So to the presence in the room she said,<br />
						"What writest thou?"&nbsp; The Vision raised her head,<br />
						And with a look of sweetest make<br />
						Said, "The names of those who love birthday cake."</p>
						<p>
						"And is mine one?" asked Jeannette.&nbsp; "Heck no,"<br />
						Replied the Angel.&nbsp; Jeannette started to bellow,<br />
						But cheerily stopped; she said "Girl, you dream,<br />
						But write me down as one who loves ice cream."</p>
						<p>
						The Angel wrote, and vanished. The next night<br />
						She came again with a great wakening light,<br />
						And showed the names whom love dessert best,<br />
						And, lo! Jeannette's name led all the rest!</p>
