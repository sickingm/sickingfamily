				<div class="poem">
						Once, in middle January, while I pondered, very merry,<br />
						Over the lengthy list of family birthdays by the score, <br />
						Sibs arrived for celebration, cake with candles, great elation, <br />
						Riotous Sicking salutations, animation as of years before. <br />
						"Where is Teresa, though," we queried, "Why not here? Wherefore?" <br />
						Only us, and no one more.<br />
						<br />
						All began to search together, heedless of the biting weather, <br />
						Looking for the dear but missing birthday honoree <br />
						Under chairs and under tables, under coats of mink, and sables, <br />
						In the attic, under gables, able not to find her. Where is she?! <br />
						Then a voice was heard so faintly, sweet above the riot, saintly, <br />
						Quoth the speaker, "I am she!" <br />
						<br />
						Taunt us not, oh voice, away now! Let your false notes not betray now <br />
						Us into an error where her presence may not be! <br />
						So we search, on hoping, looking, though the food has finished cooking, <br />
						Though the beer has been partooken, tooken by the DBC. <br />
						Once again above the clamor, boldly now, without a stammer, <br />
						Cries the speaker, "I AM she!" <br />
						<br />
						And Teresa, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting, <br />
						Waiting for some sense to come to loved ones such as us, <br />
						Though the cake is fast a-crumbling, still we hear the voice a-mumbling, <br />
						O'er the sound of family stumbling, rumbling as we make a fuss. <br />
						Saying yet, with resignation, through the end of celebration, <br />
						Quoth Teresa, "I am she."</div>
