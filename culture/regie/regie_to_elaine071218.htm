				<p class="title">ODE TO LONNIE JO</p>
					<div class="poem">
						<p>It was December nineteenth, a chilly Texas evening turning hazy, <br />
						I was out Christmas shopping and my children were home being lazy. <br />
						Then at dinnertime I stopped and drove back to the house to eat, <br />
						Came in and hollered at the back door, "Who wants food? I just drove through 
						McD's." <br />
						And then I said I got some news for you, and it's really nifty. <br />
						Today your Aunt Elaine Dolores McInerney's turning fifty." </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Patrick said, "Hey, Mom," as he grabbed a double burger with cheese, <br />
						"You got the wrong size fries again. Pass the ketchup please. <br />
						There are no more McNuggets in the box. Is there any more chow?" <br />
						And I said, "Now don't complain. You kids are too spoiled anyhow." <br />
						I said, "When we were growing up we never ate out. We were always thrifty."
						<br />
						And I repeated, "Did you hear me say that Aunt Elaine's turning fifty?" </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Sarah said to me, "Mom, we've heard your tragic tale before <br />
						But it's hard to believe. You must surely have eaten out more." <br />
						I said, "There was this one occasion when Elaine and Dad, they ate out. <br />
						It was at Howard Johnson's restaurant, cause she promised not to be a Girl 
						Scout." <br />
						But Sarah wasn't really listening. Her attention was now getting drifty. <br />
						I murmured, "It was forty years ago, and now Elaine is turning fifty!" </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Then I said I recollected that Lainey one day jumped a fence <br />
						And ripped a hole in my favorite pants. "It just made no sense. <br />
						Johnny Scheiszer, Carol Hagan, all her friends were roaming round the town.
						<br />
						And she wore my favorite jeans so she'd look cool as they hung around. <br />
						She never even asked if she could wear them. That was really shifty." <br />
						And Sarah asked me, "How the heck does that relate to Aunt E. turning 
						fifty?" </p>
						<p></p>
						<p>The years have come and gone since I lived at home with O and J, <br />
						Nancy, Mark, Matt, and Paul, and our celebrated dear Elaine, <br />
						Joseph, Clare, Julie, Laura, Mexicans, and Grandpa Art. <br />
						When I recall those happy times these days, it tugs right at my heart. <br />
						And I remember Lainey always made us laugh. That was such a gift, E., <br />
						And I am blessed, delighted to have shared your years amounting now to 
						fifty. <br />
