			Dearest Clare,<br />
			Of memory fair--<br />
			OK, not fair but good.<br />
			Not good but great.<br />
			Can't overstate<br />
			Her mental gifts. Who could?<p>She knows it all<br />
			With great recall<br />
			Remembers family lore<br />
			From '63<br />
			To now, you see<br />
			(Perhaps even before).</p>
			<p>Preventing rift<br />
			Here is my gift<br />
			On this, your natal day:<br />
			I'll now agree<br />
			We had A/C<br />
			On any date you say.</div>
