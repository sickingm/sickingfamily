					<div class="poem">
						Sing a song for Nancy, <br />
						Sixty-one<br />
						Loves to take a chance, she's<br />
						Lots of fun.
						<p>Long ago she made up<br />
						Songs and games<br />
						Never dreamed that now she'd <br />
						Be a gambling dame. </p>
						<p>Take her down to Tunica,<br />
						Or the boats,<br />
						Indian casinos,<br />
						Harrah's moats. </p>
						<p>Watch her pull the lever,<br />
						Smiles and tears,<br />
						Slot machine fever<br />
						Grips her recent years. </p>
						<p>Temperature's not normal,<br />
						Things are hot<br />
						When you watch our Nancy<br />
						Feed a nickel slot. </p>
						<p>Happy birthday, Nancy,<br />
						Sixty-one.<br />
						All your sibling fans, we<br />
						Hope you win some mon.
