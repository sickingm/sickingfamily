						This happy day, we send you all our<br />
						Birthday wishes hearty, <br />
						But owe you our apologies<br />
						About your birthday parties.<p>
						Fred, forty birthdays you have shared<br />
						With us, of sixty-one.<br />
						In shame we hang our heads about<br />
						The yearly deed we've done.</p>
						<p>We really don't intend, you know,<br />
						To seem so rude and spiteful<br />
						When every crumb of cake we eat<br />
						Ere you complete one biteful. </p>
						<p>That's two-thirds of your birthday cakes<br />
						We've gluttonously downed,<br />
						So our regrets we send you for<br />
						Our Judgment, so un-Sound.
