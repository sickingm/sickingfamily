						On Six Seven Eight, <br />
						Most auspicious date, <br />
						May all of your wishes come true, <br />
						For hot dogs and Paydays, <br />
						Sun for the wedding day, <br />
						Skies that are shining and blue.
						<p>Cake all aflame<br />
						With wax dripped on your name<br />
						Inscribed in the icing upon it,<br />
						Fifty-five candles<br />
						That melt on your sandals -<br />
						Blow them out faster, doggone it. </p>
						<p>On Six Seven Eight<br />
						May you be blessed by fate.<br />
						I send to you all my good wishes<br />
						I broadcast this call, Paul<br />
						And hope most of all, Paul,<br />
						That you will not have to do dishes</div>
