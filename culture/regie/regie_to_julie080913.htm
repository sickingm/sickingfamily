						Truly, dear Julie<br />
						I wish you the bestest<br />
						Alarm-clock-free morning,<br />
						French pancakes for breakfast,
						<p>Syrupy, buttery,<br />
						A la grand chef Mark<br />
						Chocolate all day,<br />
						From dawn until dark. </p>
						<p>My wishes are dishes<br />
						Of ice cream and cream puffs,<br />
						The heck with that fiber<br />
						Drop that nutrition-stuff </p>
						<p>Leave that for school days.<br />
						Hoist your cholesterol<br />
						Eat Danish pastry,<br />
						Slimed with a butter ball. </p>
						<p>One Thousand Layer<br />
						Cake (might you please share?)<br />
						Top it all off with<br />
						A few peanut squares. </p>
						<p>When sleepy, then deeply<br />
						Fall into a dream,<br />
						Of owning your very own<br />
						Store - Krispy Kreme.
