<p class=title>To Paul On Account Of It's His Birthday</p>
<div class="poem">
Famous people like Lauren Bacall,<br />
Humphrey Bogart, and Monty Hall,<br />
Brian Flynn and Denny Wall,<br />
Mortimer Snerd and Arlene Dahl,<br />
Have gathered in places like Senegal, <br />
East Tel Aviv, and the Wailing Wall,<br />
And a shopping mall in Montreal,<br />
An upscale club in East Nepal,<br />
And the Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall.<br />
(And six were crammed in a shower stall)<br />
To make a congratulatory call<br />
To my youngest brother, Sicking, Paul<br />
But you were playing a game of hand ball.<br />
<br />
Now it's up to me: "Happy Birthday, Paul."
