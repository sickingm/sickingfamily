						Come, my Love, my Life,<br />
						Though far away, be near<br />
						And hold me, though we sleep alone.<br />
						I feel your presence here.
						<p>May this weekend grant you laughter,<br />
						Reflection, friends, and grace.<br />
						As you receive the Lord with joy,<br />
						With joy I see your face. </p>
