<font size="3">Hey, Sarah,<br />
<br />
I know this is a day early but knowing me, I'll forget tomorrow.
Anyway, you've undoubtedly heard from your mother what an exceptional
and deeply moving poet I am. If not, I'm sure you'd be interested in
some of the breath taking works of poetry perpetrated by me and several
of your mother's other siblings, as preserved for all time and all
mankind at www.sickingfamily.com/culture/culture.htm<br />
<br />
What this is all leading up to is that the Poetry Muse struck me again
and I felt the need to write you a birthday poem. Well, not a poem
exactly, more of a ditty. Well not even a ditty, just some words that
sort of rhyme and come close to having the meaning I intended. So
anyway the Muse struck me, perhaps a bit too hard. This was what came
out.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: normal;"><b>Mary had a

<br />
Okay so I'm not Robert Frost.<br />
<br />
Love <br />
<br />
Uncle Matt<br />
<br />
PS Actually, there's probably all kinds of deeper meaning and metaphor
and allegory and allusion and imagery and symbolism in the poem.
Generally, though, despite my obvious talent in writing, I am somewhat
lacking in my ability to analyze poetry. So I don't really know what
this poem means. I have some ideas, though:</font>

clearly an allusion to your mom having given birth to you 18 years ago.
What a sweet little lamb Mary Regis bore!<br />
Or else it's about some shepherd named Mary. I mean, who can really
tell? That's the magic and mystery of poetry. </font></td>

      <td width="687"><font size="3">This is
what's called "foreshadowing". In other words the poet is looking
forward in time to something that's going to happen. In this case the
thing that is going to happen is the fourth line of the poem - the one
that that ends with "niece". Knowing that this line was going to
happen, the poet realized he needed the second line to end with
"fleece" or "cease" or "geese" or "police" or "John Cleese" - something
that rhymes with "niece". But those other words didn't make sense in
the context of the lamb. (This is a deep insight into how the creative
mind works.) </font></td>

      <td width="687"><font size="3">This is
the poet's clever way of making sure that the reader realizes that this
poem is about Sarah. Not just any Sarah, but Sarah Neff - the only
Sarah of whom Matt is an uncle. It is also the poet's subtle way of
getting his own name into the poem. This is called self-aggrandizement.

      <td width="687"><font size="3">I think
this whole stanza is fraught with imagery and all those other things.
Notice the masculine rhyme of "there a" with "Sarah". This is a symbol
for the fact that the poet was masculine (I prefer to think of the poet
as not just masculine, but macho and buff, too, but I don't think the
symbolism quite reaches that far.)<br />
Also note the "I ask myself". This is imagery of the highest order for
self-introspection. The poet is looking deep into himself and is
feeling very self-satisfied. This is mainly because he's just finished
reading most of the poem by now, and really likes this particular work
of art. Also he's self-satisfied because - doing some more of the
foreshadowing I mentioned earlier - he realizes that the poem will
indeed have a "Happy Birthday, Sarah" message in it which was the
reason he wrote the poem in the first place.</font></td>
