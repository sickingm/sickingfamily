						Laura 'Ginia, Sister Dear<br />
						On 12/29 of every year<br />
						It seems I'm always fated<br />
						To send birthday wishes on to you <br />
						However heartfelt, warm and true <br />
						Just a smidgeon late. It<br />
						Seems so understated<br />
						To say I appreciate it<br />
						That, although I know you hate it,<br />
						You've not recriminated<br />
						Me for being addlepated<br />
						Re this mess that I've created.<br />
						My transgression's not negated.<br />
						I know how long you've waited.<br />
						But as earlier I stated<br />
						I still send this card belated.</div>
