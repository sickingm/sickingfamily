			Alane Inez Sharkaway<br />
			Macaroni, your dossier<br />
			Says right here that yesterday<br />
			Was, in fact, your natal day.<br />
			On account of this I deeply pray<br />
			That it was great in every way.<br />
			I hope you got a chance to play<br />
			And dance and sing at your soiree.<br />
			And porked out at a huge buffet<br />
			Of curds &amp; whey, and cheese souffl&eacute;<br />
			And perhaps an apricot sorbet<br />
			Topped with a Snickers and a Milky Way,<br />
			Served on a lovely silver tray<br />
			Followed by caf&eacute; au lait<br />
			At an upper crust and chic caf&eacute;,<br />
			Or perhaps a noisy cabaret.<br />
			And now this wish on you I lay,<br />
			Before tonight you hit the hay:<br />
			That you never be tracked by the CIA<br />
			Or the IRA or the KKK.<br />
			Nor meet a death like JFK<br />
			Or Tim McVeigh or JonBenet.<br />
			Or suffer much from tooth decay<br />
			Be struck down by a Chevrolet<br />
			Or bitten by a manta ray<br />
			I only wish that I could say<br />
			That
			I sent this to you yesterday.</div>
