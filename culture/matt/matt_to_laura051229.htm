<p class=title>To Laura, On Her Fortieth Birthday</p>
<div class="poem">
Dear Laura 'Ginia Sicking, on this occasion of your birth<br />
I thought I'd write for you a poem of joy and wit and mirth.<br />
Perhaps a sonnet or a limerick, or a sentimental ode,<br />
Or a forty chapter epic on how you once bestowed<br />
A shine on your commode. <br />
(In Greek or Morse code.)
<p>So I grabbed my quill and parchment and went searching for some rhymes<br />
That would decorate the endings to these heartfelt cultured lines.<br />
And I sought some way to aptly say in a manner well designed<br />
How you're lovely, brave and witty, and considerate and kind - <br />
A joy to all mankind. <br />
But nothing came to mind. </p>
<p>A poem with just four stanzas would be all I'd need to write. <br />
As long as it was clever and not too tricky to recite. <br />
But I was getting nowhere. It was like my brain was going numb. <br />
I sighed and hummed, and, growing glum, I scratched my head and drummed my 
thumb, <br />
The words just wouldn't come. <br />
I was feeling pretty dumb. </p>
<p>I slapped myself reproachfully. It was time to get to work. <br />
I had a birthday poem to write. I couldn't shirk this like a jerk. <br />
&quot;I must. I must,&quot; I said, nonplussed. &quot;I can't ignore this sacred trust.&quot; <br />
In a cloud of dust I fussed and cussed. But my feeble mind had gone to rust. <br />
And so I just <br />
Gave up in sheer disgust.</div>
