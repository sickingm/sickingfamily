				This Bud's for you, O sister mine<br />
				Raise your arm and tilt your stein<br />
				(The one that came from the River Rhine)<br />
				And have some beer, ignore the wine,<br />
				Then grab your fork and stick its tine<br />
				Into the meat on which you'll dine<br />
				Tonight on all that cuisine fine.<br />
				And know my thoughts are all of thine<br />
				(At least as far as I opine.)<br />
				I can't come up with one more line<br />
				I wanted one to end with &quot;pine&quot;,<br />
				Or &quot;fine&quot;, or &quot;brine&quot;, or 
				&quot;Columbine&quot;,<br />
				&quot;Benign&quot;, &quot;combine&quot;, or &quot;realign&quot;, 
				<br />
				But I ran completely out of time.<br />
				So Happy Birthday, Number Nine.
