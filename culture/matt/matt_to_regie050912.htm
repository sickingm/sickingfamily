			To Regie On The Occasion of <br />
			Her Fiftieth Birthday</p>
			<div class="poem">
			I got up this morning and ran in place, <br />
			Brushed my teeth and washed my face.
			<br />
			And as I stood and stared at the mirror <br />
			I saw on my cheek a glistening tear. <br />
			Not from my allergies, and not from fear, <br />
			It was caused by the weighty and utterly sheer <br />
			Impact of realizing with terribly clear <br />
			Insight as my mind finally got into gear <br />
			That my number two sister whom I think as a dear <br />
			Young lady with nary a peer <br />
			Was having a birthday again this year <br />
			Without us there to share in the cheer. <br />
			She's out there in Texas and meanwhile we're <br />
			Here in St. Louis drinking all of the beer
