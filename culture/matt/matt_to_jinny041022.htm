				<div class="poem">
				This is Jinny's birthday poem.  It starts out kind of slow.<br />
				The later verses aren't much better as birthday verses go.<p>
				The rhyme scheme's nothing special, and the scansion's often wrong.<br />
				And it would take a magic melody to make this poem a song.  <p>
				Though there is alliteration in the last foregoing line,<br />
				And close examination shows each couplet tends to rhyme.<p>
				But the whole poem lacks a message, not even "Happy birthday"<br />
				There's no real theme to speak of, and it lacks feeling in the worst way.<p>
				To say nothing of allusion or onomatopoeia.<br />
				In retrospect it seems to be just verbal diarrhea.<br />
