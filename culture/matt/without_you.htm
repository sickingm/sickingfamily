				It seems to me on days like this when you're staying somewhere else,<br />
				In a sense I feel I'm missing, too.<br />
				Like gray in a photo that should be blue,<br />
				I'm here, but I'm not myself. <br /><br />
				I'm glad you have a chance 
				like this to get away without concern.<br />
				A time to yourself, to think, to pray,<br />
				To refresh yourself for another day. <br />
				But I long for your return. </div>
