				<div class ="poem">
				I thought I'd get this note in late<br />
				But when I checked this morning's date<br />
				I wiped sweat off my graying pate<br />
				And told myself &quot;Hey, this is great.<br />
				No need to chastise or berate<br />
				Myself for making Nancy wait.&quot;<br />
				So freed from such an awful weight<br />
				I jumped at once from the starting gate<br />
				And grabbed some chalk and a writing slate<br />
				And penned these lines at my estate<br />
				Arranging them in such a state<br />
				To which my sister could relate.<br />
				So let me say, at any rate,<br />
				I sincerely hope that you don't hate<br />
				It now that you've reached Fifty-Eight.<br />
				Happy Birthday, Sister Kate.
