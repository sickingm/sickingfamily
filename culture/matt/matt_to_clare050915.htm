<p class=title>To Clare</p>
<div class="poem">
I do declare (I do, I swear) <br />
That number four sister yclept Clare <br />
With grace and style beyond compare <br />
Deserves a special birthday prayer. <br />
And I will try to do my share <br />
Avoiding words of stale hot air. <br />
To author one with utmost care <br />
With an upbeat air and flair to spare <br />
(Just like Julian Javier) <br />
To wit: may you someday be a billionaire.
