					<div class="poem">
						It was fifty years ago today that Mom and Dad decided<br />
						That it was time to let the world in on the truth:<br />
						That Matthew was their favorite kid - not Mark or Nancy, Paul,<br />
						Or Laura, Julie, Clare or Rege or Ruth.
						<p>For on this day in '57 they took decisive action<br />
						When first they gazed on lovely little Lane<br />
						And realized what a special person she would likely be<br />
						And so special, too, indeed, must be her name. </p>
						<p>Although for all these years you've thought that you must be their 
						favorite<br />
						That line of thinking clearly holds no water.<br />
						For just consider what they did that day:<br />
						They named Elaine in honor of my daughter.</div>
