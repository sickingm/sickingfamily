						You may talk o' this an' that<br />
						An' givin' gifts to Matt<br />
						Fit for a noble prince's heir apparents.
						<p>But when it's time to name a present<br />
						That's most particularly pleasant<br />
						I'd have to choose the one from both my parents.</p>
						<p>It was on a recent Turkey Day<br />
						At my parents' quaint chalet<br />
						With my fam'ly I was talkin', laughin', visitin'</p>
						<p>That first dad an' then my mom<br />
						Said to me &quot;I love you, Son.&quot;<br />
						Now that's the perfect gift from Ollie/Jin.</div>
