					<p>Dear Libbyanne Sicking Nguyen,</p>
 
<p>I see that it's your birthday again.  I was going to write a poem for<br />
you, and any old ditty just wouldn't do.  But I had one of those days<br />
like I do sometimes when I compose my thoughts but nothing<br />
rhymes. I almost gave up but I hate to fail, and doing nothing<br />
 would for sure be worse, so I opted for sending this crummy email<br />
in plain old prose all devoid of verse.
</p>
<p>Happy birthday!</p>
<p>Love you very much.</p>
<p>Dad</p>
