					<div class="poem">
						Oh Clare, with your teeth 
						shining silver and bright <br />
						Please help me find my way home late at night.<p>
						
						When all is dark and dreary, looking so murky and bleak,<br />
						I look for your mouth and hope to see its shining streak.<p>
						
						The brilliant glow that your metal sets forth<br />
						Guides me back like the star in the north.<p>
						
						Without your help where would I be<br />
						When I've boozed it up and hardly able to see.</p>

						Thank you for the service you perform<br />
						Like a guiding light in a terrible storm.</p>
