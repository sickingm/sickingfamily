						Happy birthday to you my brother Mark<br />
						I'm off to England on a lark <br />
						Won't be there to greet your day<br />
						As I'll be so far, far away <br />
						So Happy Birthday to you now <br />
						If I were you I'd take a bow <br />
						Being so old is quite a cue <br />
						While I'm away I'll drink to you!
