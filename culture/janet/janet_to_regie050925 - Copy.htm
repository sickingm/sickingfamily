			<p class="title">Regie's Birthday 2005</p>
			<div class="poem">
			I finally flew home from Dallas through Salt Lake</br>
			With a tired body and a queasy stomach-ache.</br>
			</br>
			The mail was piled high, there were messages galore</br>
			the kitchen was straightened but with dirt on the floor.</br>
			</br>
			I opened the mail, unpacked my bags</br>
			Threw clothes in the washer to clean my traveling rags.</br>
			</br>
			Came upstairs with the thought of going to bed</br>
			But checked the computer for messages instead.</br>
			</br>
			To my delight I found a poem so witty with rhyme</br>
			Summing up the birthday party where we all had a good time.</br>
			</br>
			It's family and memories that mean the most</br>
			Even if it involves traveling from St. Louis and the west coast.</br>
			</br>
			When you live far away it's nice to be included</br>
			Which is why Paul and I decided not to stay secluded.</br>
			</br>
			It's a big deal to turn 50, it happens only once</br>
			As I shall see for myself in only a few months.</br>
			</br>
			It seemed you were surprised, never expected a thing,</br>
			So having family show up was the best present we could bring.</br>
			</br>
			Having siblings so funny sharing poems and stories</br>
			Overshadowed the Dodie's owner who was consumed with trivial 
			worries.</br>
			</br>
			It won't be too long Regie before we see you again</br>
			I hope it's in April when Libby marries a Nguyen. (nu-when)
